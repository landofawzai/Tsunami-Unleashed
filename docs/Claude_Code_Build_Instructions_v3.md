# Distribution System Dashboard — Claude Code Build Instructions

## How to Use This Document

This document contains **10 sessions** of detailed instructions you will give to Claude Code to build a complete Distribution System Dashboard. Each session builds on the previous one.

**Before you start:**
1. Create an empty project folder on your machine (e.g., `distribution-dashboard`)
2. Open your terminal and `cd` into that folder
3. Start Claude Code
4. Copy and paste the Session 1 prompt below into Claude Code
5. Let it build, test, fix any issues
6. Move to Session 2

**Between sessions:** You can close Claude Code and come back later. When you start a new session, begin by telling Claude Code: *"Read through this project and understand the codebase before we continue."* Then paste the next session prompt.

**If something breaks:** Tell Claude Code what happened. Paste error messages directly. Say *"I got this error when I tried to [action]. Fix it."* Claude Code can debug in real time.

## System-Wide Integration Standard

This section defines how all six automation pillars (Content Creation, Content Repurposing, Distribution, Communication, Administration, Discipling/Coaching) and the Translation Pipeline interoperate. Each pillar is a standalone system — separate codebase, separate deployment, no shared dependencies. They communicate through Google Drive (shared filesystem) and Pabbly Connect (event routing).

### The Integration Contract

Every pillar follows three rules:

1. **Read from and write to Google Drive using agreed folder paths**
2. **Include a metadata sidecar JSON file with every content piece**
3. **Pabbly Connect routes events between pillars — pillars never call each other directly**

This means any pillar can be rebuilt, replaced, or taken offline without breaking the others. If the Repurposing pillar goes down, the Distribution pillar still picks up anything manually placed in the Derivatives folder. If the Translation pillar is replaced with a completely different tool, as long as it drops files into `/Translations/{lang}/` with a valid sidecar, everything downstream works.

### Metadata Sidecar Format

Every content file in Google Drive is accompanied by a `.meta.json` file with the same base name. Example: `vine-and-branches.mp4` is paired with `vine-and-branches.meta.json`.

```json
{
  "contentId": "unique-id-generated-by-creating-pillar",
  "title": "The Vine and the Branches - John 15 Teaching",
  "contentType": "sermon",
  "language": "en",
  "sourceFile": "vine-and-branches.mp4",
  "mimeType": "video/mp4",
  "createdBy": "content_creation",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-09T14:30:00Z",
  "parentContentId": null,
  "isDerivative": false,
  "derivativeType": null,
  "tags": ["john-15", "discipleship", "abiding"],
  "targetLanguages": ["hi", "bn", "ur", "ta", "te"],
  "flags": {
    "readyForRepurposing": true,
    "readyForTranslation": true,
    "readyForDistribution": false,
    "highValueForSyndication": true,
    "needsHumanReview": false
  },
  "processingHistory": [
    {
      "pillar": "content_creation",
      "action": "created",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-09T14:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field rules:**
- `contentId`: Generated by whichever pillar creates the item. Must be globally unique (use cuid or uuid).
- `createdBy`: One of `"content_creation"`, `"repurposing"`, `"translation"`, `"distribution"`, `"communication"`, `"discipling"`, `"manual"`.
- `parentContentId`: Links derivatives and translations back to their source. The Distribution pillar uses this to group related content.
- `flags`: Each pillar reads the flags relevant to it and updates the ones it owns. The creating pillar sets initial flags. Downstream pillars update them after processing.
- `processingHistory`: Append-only log. Each pillar adds an entry when it processes the item. This creates an audit trail without pillars needing to communicate directly.
- `highValueForSyndication`: When true, the Distribution pillar routes this to Tier 4 native upload queue (Ubot batch-uploads to satellite accounts). Set by Content Creation or Repurposing for the most impactful content.

### Google Drive Folder Contract

Each pillar owns specific folders. Other pillars may READ from any folder but only WRITE to folders they own or to designated handoff folders.

```

  📁 Source Content/                    ← OWNED BY: Content Creation pillar

```

### Pabbly Connect Event Routing

Pabbly is the central nervous system. It watches Google Drive folders and routes events between pillars. No pillar triggers another pillar directly.

**Content flow through the system:**

```
Content Creation drops sermon in /Source Content/Sermons/
  └─ Pabbly Trigger: New file in Source Content
       ├─ Route 1: Notify Repurposing pillar (or trigger its workflow)
       ├─ Route 2: Notify Translation Pipeline (or trigger its workflow)
       └─ Route 3: If flags.readyForDistribution == true, trigger Distribution

Repurposing pillar drops clips in /Derivatives/Video Clips/
  └─ Pabbly Trigger: New file in Derivatives
       ├─ Route 1: Notify Translation Pipeline (translate the derivatives)
       └─ Route 2: Trigger Distribution (derivatives go to Tier 2 + Tier 3)

Translation Pipeline drops translated sermon in /Translations/hi/
  └─ Pabbly Trigger: New file in Translations
       └─ Route 1: Trigger Distribution (routed by language to Tier 1 or Tier 2)

Communication pillar captures testimony in /Communication/Testimonies/
  └─ Pabbly Trigger: New file in Testimonies
       └─ Route 1: Notify Content Creation (testimony may become source content)

Discipling pillar requests starter kit for new language
  └─ Pabbly Trigger: New request in Discipleship
       └─ Route 1: Check if content exists in Distribution, notify if gap
```

**Pabbly workflow naming convention:**
- `ROUTE-[source]-to-[destination]` (e.g., `ROUTE-SourceContent-to-Repurposing`, `ROUTE-Derivatives-to-Distribution`)
- `INTERNAL-[pillar]-[action]` (e.g., `INTERNAL-Distribution-PostToFollowrQueue`)
- `MAINTENANCE-[schedule]` (e.g., `MAINTENANCE-DailyMetrics`)

### Cross-Pillar Content ID Tracking

When a pillar processes content, it preserves the `contentId` from the metadata sidecar. This means:
- A sermon created by Content Creation (`contentId: "abc123"`) keeps that ID through Repurposing, Translation, and Distribution
- Derivatives reference it via `parentContentId: "abc123"`
- Translations reference it via `parentContentId: "abc123"` with their own unique `contentId`
- The Distribution dashboard can trace any piece of content back to its origin
- The Communication pillar can reference content IDs when responding to inquiries

No central database coordinates this. The `contentId` in the sidecar IS the coordination mechanism.

### Future Pillar Build Instructions

When building each subsequent pillar, the build instructions document for that pillar should:
1. Reference this Integration Standard
2. Specify which folders it READS from and WRITES to
3. Define its Pabbly trigger and route requirements
4. Document any new sidecar fields or flags it introduces
5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing sidecar format (add fields, never remove)

Current pillar build documents:
- **Distribution System Dashboard** — this document (Sessions 1-10)
- **Content Repurposing Pipeline** — not yet built
- **Translation Pipeline Tool** — not yet built
- **Communication System** — not yet built
- **Administration System** — partially covered by Distribution dashboard
- **Discipling/Coaching System** — not yet built

### How Sidecars Map to Dashboard Webhooks

The metadata sidecar (`.meta.json`) is the universal format across all pillars. The Distribution dashboard webhooks (Session 2) accept a simpler flat payload. This is by design — Pabbly Connect reads the sidecar and maps relevant fields to the webhook call. Not all sidecar fields are sent to the dashboard. The dashboard tracks distribution status, not full content metadata.

Example mapping (Pabbly reads sidecar → calls webhook):
- Sidecar `contentId` → not sent at initial intake (dashboard generates its own `id`), but used as `parentContentId` for derivatives/translations
- Sidecar `title` → webhook `title`
- Sidecar `contentType` → webhook `contentType`
- Sidecar `language` → webhook `language`
- Sidecar `flags.readyForDistribution` → Pabbly uses this to decide whether to trigger Distribution workflows (never sent to dashboard)
- Sidecar `flags.highValueForSyndication` → Pabbly uses this to decide whether to create a Syndication Upload Queue JSON (never sent to dashboard)
- Sidecar `processingHistory` → not sent to dashboard; the dashboard maintains its own timeline via DistributionLog entries

The sidecar is the source of truth for cross-pillar coordination. The dashboard webhook payloads are the source of truth for distribution tracking. They overlap but serve different purposes.

## Architecture Context: Four-Tier Distribution Strategy

This system uses a four-tier distribution architecture designed for resilience and persecution resistance:

**Tier 1 — RSSground Private Feeds (150 lifetime slots)**
The vault. Depth/discipleship content only. Core sermons, foundational teachings. Protected by RSSground's infrastructure. These are the most valuable feeds and hardest to replace. Integrated natively with Pabbly Connect. Never waste a Tier 1 slot on derivative or ephemeral content.

**Tier 2 — External/Self-Built Feeds (unlimited, low cost)**
The expansion layer. Derivatives, additional languages, topical series, partner content. Hosted on Ghost CMS, Cloudflare Workers, or custom-built RSS generators. Cheap to scale, easy to replace if a host goes down.

**Tier 3 — Platform-Native Distribution (most vulnerable)**
The discovery layer. Branded social media, messaging apps, video platforms. If any platform disappears, Tiers 1 and 2 continue delivering. Followr handles most social platforms via Ubot Studio automation; Pabbly handles messaging and edge cases; Robomotion covers platforms Followr doesn't support.

**Tier 4 — IFTTT Syndication Networks (fingerprint-free amplification)**
The scattering layer. Hundreds of unbranded satellite accounts (Blogger, WordPress, Tumblr, etc.) organized into multi-ring IFTTT syndication networks. Two content streams: (1) IFTTT autopilot pulls from Tier 1/2 RSS feeds and auto-posts text + images with zero intervention, (2) Ubot Studio batch-uploads native video/audio to satellite accounts using the master login spreadsheet. All accounts use unique personas — different names, bios, locations, profile images. No backlinks, no attribution, no fingerprints tracing back to HQ. Content appears to originate from independent local believers. CC0 license makes this legally clean. One-time setup cost per language (~$50-150 for a 2-tier network of 75-200+ accounts). After setup, runs forever with near-zero maintenance.

**Resilience logic:** Tier 3 ban → Tiers 1+2+4 unaffected. Tier 4 accounts get suspended → other rings continue, rebuild cheaply. Tier 2 host down → spin up another, Tier 1 safe. RSSground disappears → Tier 2 feeds continue, rebuild Tier 1 on new infrastructure. HQ disappears → Tier 4 satellite accounts keep auto-posting from RSS feeds indefinitely. No single point of failure.

## Tool Responsibility Matrix

This system uses eight tools, each with a specific non-overlapping role:

| Tool | Role | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| **RSSground** | Tier 1 RSS feeds only. Depth content. No social posting. | Tier 1 |
| **Ghost/Cloudflare** | Tier 2 external feeds. Expansion content. | Tier 2 |
| **Followr** | Social media scheduling & posting UI. Handles Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, YouTube, Medium. | Tier 3 |
| **Ubot Studio** | Browser automation bot. Three jobs: (1) Logs into Followr and schedules Tier 3 branded posts. (2) Batch-uploads native video/audio to Tier 4 satellite accounts. (3) Calls dashboard webhooks after posting. | Automation glue (Tier 3 + Tier 4) |
| **Robomotion** | Browser automation for edge-case platforms Followr doesn't cover: Rumble, Odysee, Signal. Backup automation layer. | Automation glue (Tier 3) |
| **Pabbly Connect** | Orchestration. Google Drive triggers → routes to RSSground or external feeds → drops post data into Followr Queue → calls dashboard webhooks. | Orchestration |
| **IFTTT** | Tier 4 syndication autopilot. Watches Tier 1/2 RSS feeds → auto-posts text + images to hundreds of unbranded satellite accounts. Runs independently after one-time setup. No dashboard integration needed. | Tier 4 |
| **Dashboard** | Tracks all content across all tiers. Receives webhooks from Pabbly, RSSground, Ubot, and Robomotion. Tier 4 operates independently — no dashboard tracking (by design, for fingerprint isolation). | Monitoring |

**The Followr Queue (Tier 3):** Pabbly drops social media post data (caption, media URL, platform targets, tags) into a Google Drive folder called "Followr Queue". Ubot Studio monitors this folder, picks up new items, logs into Followr, schedules the posts, then calls the dashboard webhook to report success/failure.

**The Syndication Upload Queue (Tier 4):** For high-value content (teaching videos, worship audio, powerful testimonies), Pabbly drops native upload instructions into a "Syndication Upload Queue" folder. Ubot Studio picks these up and batch-uploads video/audio files natively to satellite accounts using the master login spreadsheet. Unlike the IFTTT autopilot (which handles text + images automatically), this gives satellite accounts rich native media that looks completely organic. Runs 2-5 times per week on the highest-impact content.

**Why Ubot instead of Followr API:** Followr's API costs $99/month. Ubot Studio (already owned, unlimited license) can operate Followr's web UI like a human — uploading content, selecting platforms, applying Autopilot tags, scheduling posts. The tradeoff is that UI changes in Followr may occasionally require bot maintenance (~1-2 hours per quarter).

**Why Tier 4 is NOT in the dashboard:** Fingerprint isolation. The dashboard tracks Tiers 1-3 (your branded infrastructure). Tier 4 satellite accounts are deliberately disconnected — no webhooks, no tracking, no digital trail linking them to HQ. If someone accesses your dashboard, they see zero evidence of the syndication network. IFTTT handles the autopilot. Ubot handles the native uploads. The master login spreadsheet lives in an encrypted, offline location.

**Tier 1 Allocation Plan (150 feeds):**
- Top 25 languages × Sermons = 25 feeds
- Top 25 languages × Discipleship/Teaching = 25 feeds
- Top 10 languages × Articles = 10 feeds
- Top 10 languages × Study Guides = 10 feeds
- English master feeds (all 4 types) = 4 feeds
- Reserved for emerging languages = 50 feeds
- Strategic reserves (test, staging, special) = 26 feeds

## SESSION 1: Project Scaffolding and Database

### What This Session Builds
- Next.js 14 project with App Router
- SQLite database with Prisma ORM
- All database tables with four-tier distribution architecture
- Seed data reflecting real RSSground + external feed setup

### Prompt for Claude Code

```
Create a Next.js 14 project with App Router for a content distribution dashboard. This dashboard tracks content flowing through an automated distribution pipeline that uses a four-tier distribution architecture:

- Tier 1: RSSground Private Feeds (150 lifetime slots) — depth/discipleship content, most protected
- Tier 2: External/Self-Built Feeds (Ghost CMS, Cloudflare Workers, etc.) — derivatives, expansion languages
- Tier 3: Platform-Native Distribution (social media, messaging) — branded discovery layer, most vulnerable
- Tier 4: IFTTT Syndication Networks (unbranded satellite accounts) — fingerprint-free amplification, not tracked in dashboard

The dashboard shows where everything is in the pipeline, which tier each feed belongs to, how much Tier 1 capacity remains, and a summary estimate of Tier 4 reach (without tracking individual satellite accounts).

PROJECT SETUP:
- Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn/UI component library (install the components: card, table, badge, button, input, tabs, dialog, dropdown-menu, separator, chart, progress, tooltip, switch, toast, skeleton, sheet, collapsible, popover, select, command)
- Additional npm packages: lucide-react (icons), swr (data fetching with auto-refresh), qrcode.react (QR codes for RSS feed URLs on the feeds page)
- Prisma ORM with SQLite database
- The project should run with "npm run dev" and show a basic page

SEED DATA:
Create a seed script (prisma/seed.ts) that populates the database with realistic sample data:

TierCapacity records:
- tier1_rssground: totalSlots 150, usedSlots 87, reservedSlots 13
- tier2_external: totalSlots 0 (unlimited), usedSlots 24, reservedSlots 0

40 ContentItem records spread across the last 14 days:
- Mix of statuses: 5 "received", 3 "queued", 5 "rss_published", 7 "platforms_posting", 17 "complete", 3 "failed"
- Mix of content types: sermons, teachings, articles, study guides
- Mix of languages: en, hi, bn, ur, ta, te, mr, gu, kn, ml (English plus 9 Indian languages)
- Mix of tiers: most depth content as "tier1_rssground", derivatives as "tier2_external", some ephemeral posts as "tier3_platform_only"
- Some should be derivatives linked to parent content items
- Realistic titles like "The Vine and the Branches - John 15 Teaching", "Prayer for the Nations - Weekly Devotional", "Household Discipleship Pattern - Starter Kit", "Oral Scripture: Mark 1-4 (Hindi Audio)"

250+ DistributionLog records linked to content items:
- Completed items should have 8-12 successful log entries across different platforms
- Include "rssground" as a platform in logs for Tier 1 content
- In-progress items should have a mix of "success" and "pending"
- Failed items should have error messages like "API rate limit exceeded", "Authentication token expired", "Content policy violation detected", "RSSground feed update failed"
- Retrying items should have retryCount of 1-3

PlatformHealth records for all platforms:
- "rssground" platform with category "tier1_rss", managedBy "rssground", status "active"
- Social platforms (facebook, x_twitter, instagram, linkedin) with category "tier3_social", managedBy "followr_ubot"
- Video platforms (youtube, tiktok) with category "tier3_video", managedBy "followr_ubot"
- Pinterest with category "tier3_social", managedBy "followr_ubot"
- Medium with category "tier3_blog", managedBy "followr_ubot"
- Messaging platforms (whatsapp, telegram, signal) with category "tier3_messaging", whatsapp managedBy "pabbly", telegram managedBy "pabbly", signal managedBy "robomotion"
- Blog platforms (substack, wordpress, blogger) with category "tier3_blog", all three managedBy "pabbly"
- Archive platforms (github, internet_archive, cloudflare_pages) with category "tier3_archive", managedBy "pabbly"
- Alternative platforms (rumble, odysee, mastodon) with category "tier3_alternative", rumble and odysee managedBy "robomotion", mastodon managedBy "pabbly"
- Tier 4 syndication summary: a single "ifttt_syndication" platform entry with category "tier4_syndication", managedBy "ifttt_ubot_syndication", status "active", displayName "IFTTT Syndication Network", notes "~200 satellite accounts across 5 languages. Not individually tracked — this is a summary placeholder only."
- Most should be "active"
- Set Instagram to "degraded" with 5 errors
- Set TikTok to "disabled"
- Set a couple auth expiration dates within next 7 days

RssFeed records — create a realistic mix of Tier 1 and Tier 2:

Tier 1 (RSSground) feeds — 87 total to match usedSlots:
- English: 4 feeds (sermons, teachings, articles, study_guides), feedSource "rssground"
- Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu: 4 feeds each (sermons, teachings, articles, study_guides) = 20
- Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Nepali, Assamese, Odia, Maithili, Bhojpuri: 2 feeds each (sermons, teachings) = 20
- 5 additional languages with 1 feed each (sermons only): Sindhi, Rajasthani, Chhattisgarhi, Magahi, Haryanvi = 5
- Remaining to reach 87: The above totals 49 feeds (4 + 20 + 20 + 5). Add 38 more by expanding coverage for existing languages: add articles feeds for the "2 feeds each" group (10 feeds), study_guide feeds for the same group (10 feeds), add teachings and articles feeds for the "1 feed each" group (10 feeds), and 8 combined feeds for emerging languages. Adjust as needed to hit exactly 87 total Tier 1 feeds.
- All with feedSource "rssground", tier "tier1_rssground"
- Varying item counts (10-150 per feed)
- Most recently updated, a couple stale (5+ days ago)

Tier 2 (External) feeds — 24 total:
- 8 derivative feeds (video clips, quote graphics) across top languages, feedSource "ghost"
- 6 combined feeds for languages not in Tier 1, feedSource "cloudflare"
- 5 topical feeds (Christmas series, prayer series, persecution encouragement), feedSource "ghost"
- 5 partner ministry feeds, feedSource "other"
- All with tier "tier2_external"
- Lower item counts (5-40 per feed)

8 Alert records:
- 3 dismissed, 5 active
- Include: one "platform_down" for Instagram, one "auth_expiring" for YouTube, two "distribution_failed", one "content_stuck", one "tier1_capacity_warning" saying "Tier 1 RSSground feeds at 58% capacity (87/150). Consider reserving slots for emerging languages.", one "feed_stale" for a Tier 2 feed not updated in 6 days
- Mix of severities

14 PipelineMetric records (one per day for last 14 days):
- General upward trend
- Vary realistically: 3-10 items received per day, 2-8 completed
- Include tier1Posts, tier2Posts, tier3Posts, tier4EstimatedPosts breakdowns (tier3 should be highest volume, tier4EstimatedPosts should be highest of all — typically 10-20x tier3 since each content piece multiplies across 200+ satellite accounts)
- Avg latency between 8-25 minutes

Run Prisma migration and seed. Verify the database has data.

PRISMA CLIENT SINGLETON:
Create a file at /lib/prisma.ts (or /src/lib/prisma.ts depending on project structure) that exports a singleton Prisma client. In Next.js development mode, hot module reloading creates new Prisma client instances on every reload, eventually exhausting database connections. The singleton pattern prevents this:

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient | undefined }

export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient()

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma

All API routes and server components must import from this file, never create their own PrismaClient instances.

VERIFICATION:
After setup, run "npm run dev" and confirm the app starts. Create a simple test page at the root that says "Distribution Dashboard" with a subtitle "Four-Tier Architecture" just to confirm it runs. We'll build real pages next session.
```

## SESSION 2: Webhook API Layer

### What This Session Builds
- All webhook endpoints that Pabbly Connect and RSSground will call
- API key authentication middleware
- Input validation
- Tier-aware routing logic
- Automatic Tier 1 capacity tracking
- Alert generation on failures

### Prompt for Claude Code

```
Now build the webhook API layer. This is a set of API endpoints that multiple systems will call:

1. Pabbly Connect — our automation orchestrator, calls webhooks at each pipeline stage
2. RSSground — our Tier 1 RSS platform, can send webhooks when posting campaigns fire
3. Ubot Studio — our browser automation bot, calls webhooks after posting to Followr or other platforms
4. Robomotion — our backup browser automation bot, calls webhooks after posting to edge-case platforms (Rumble, Odysee, Signal)

All four systems send HTTP requests to our dashboard when things happen. The dashboard updates its database so we always know the status of every content item.

Read through the existing Prisma schema first to understand the data model, especially the tier fields and TierCapacity table.

AUTHENTICATION MIDDLEWARE:
Create middleware that checks for an API key in the "x-api-key" header on all /api/webhooks/* routes. Expected key comes from WEBHOOK_API_KEY environment variable. Missing or wrong key returns 401 with { "error": "Unauthorized" }. Add WEBHOOK_API_KEY=dev-key-change-me to .env for local development.

Also create a secondary key RSSGROUND_WEBHOOK_KEY in .env for RSSground-specific webhooks. The /api/webhooks/rssground/* routes should accept either key (since RSSground's webhook format may differ from Pabbly's).

Note: Ubot Studio and Robomotion will use the same WEBHOOK_API_KEY as Pabbly when calling the standard webhook endpoints (platform-posted, platform-failed, etc.). They are just different clients calling the same API.

WEBHOOK ENDPOINTS:

Note on Integration Standard: The System-Wide Integration Standard (above) defines a rich .meta.json sidecar that travels with every content file in Google Drive. The dashboard webhooks below accept a simpler flat payload. This is by design — Pabbly reads the sidecar when a new file appears in Google Drive and maps the relevant fields into the webhook request body. Not all sidecar fields are sent to the dashboard. The dashboard tracks distribution status and pipeline flow. Full content metadata (tags, targetLanguages, processingHistory, flags) lives in the sidecar and is consumed by other pillars directly.

1. POST /api/webhooks/content-received
   Purpose: Pabbly calls this when new content arrives in Google Drive.
   Request body:
   {
     "title": "string, required",
     "contentType": "string, required — sermon | teaching | article | study_guide",
     "language": "string, required — ISO 639-1 code",
     "sourceUrl": "string, optional — Google Drive URL",
     "tier": "string, optional — tier1_rssground | tier2_external | tier3_platform_only, defaults to tier1_rssground for sermons/teachings, tier2_external for derivatives",
     "parentContentId": "string, optional — if this is a derivative",
     "isDerivative": "boolean, optional, default false",
     "derivativeType": "string, optional — video_clip | quote_graphic | audio_extraction | thread_summary | study_guide",
     "platformsTargeted": "number, optional — how many platforms this content should be posted to. If provided, the dashboard will auto-complete the item when platformsCompleted reaches this number via platform-posted webhooks. If not provided (default 0), the item stays in 'platforms_posting' until pipeline-complete is called explicitly."
   }
   Logic:
   - Validate required fields. Return 400 if missing.
   - Auto-assign tier if not provided:
     - Sermons and teachings default to "tier1_rssground"
     - Derivatives always get "tier2_external"
     - Articles and study_guides default to "tier1_rssground" if the language has a Tier 1 feed for that content type, otherwise "tier2_external"
   - Create ContentItem with status "received", set platformsTargeted if provided
   - If parentContentId provided, verify parent exists
   - Return 200 with created ContentItem including id

2. POST /api/webhooks/content-queued
   Purpose: Pabbly calls this when content enters the processing queue (after receipt, before RSS publishing). This bridges the "received" → "queued" → "rss_published" pipeline stages.
   Request body:
   {
     "contentId": "string, required"
   }
   Logic:
   - Find ContentItem by id. Return 404 if not found.
   - Update status to "queued".
   - Return 200 with updated ContentItem.
   Note: This endpoint is optional — if Pabbly's workflow moves straight from receipt to RSS publishing without a queuing step, skip this call and the item will transition directly from "received" to "rss_published". The "queued" status exists for workflows where there's a delay between intake and feed publishing (e.g., content awaiting translation or repurposing before distribution).

3. POST /api/webhooks/rss-published
   Purpose: Pabbly calls this after pushing content to RSSground (Tier 1) or an external feed (Tier 2).
   Request body:
   {
     "contentId": "string, required",
     "feedUrl": "string, optional",
     "feedSource": "string, optional — rssground | ghost | cloudflare | custom",
     "feedTier": "string, optional — tier1_rssground | tier2_external"
   }
   Logic:
   - Find ContentItem by id. Return 404 if not found.
   - Update status to "rss_published", set rssPublishedAt to now.
   - If feedUrl provided, find or create RssFeed record and increment itemCount.
   - If creating a new RssFeed with tier "tier1_rssground", increment TierCapacity usedSlots.
   - If TierCapacity usedSlots exceeds 120 (80% of 150), create a "tier1_capacity_warning" alert if one doesn't already exist.
   - Also create a DistributionLog entry with platform "rssground" and status "success" for Tier 1 content.
   - Return 200 with updated ContentItem.

4. POST /api/webhooks/platform-posted
   Purpose: Pabbly or RSSground calls this after each successful platform post.
   Request body:
   {
     "contentId": "string, required",
     "platform": "string, required",
     "postUrl": "string, optional",
     "postedBy": "string, optional — rssground | pabbly | followr_ubot | robomotion | manual, defaults to pabbly"
   }
   Logic:
   - Find ContentItem by id. Return 404 if not found.
   - Create DistributionLog entry with status "success".
   - Increment platformsCompleted.
   - Add platform to platformsPosted (comma-separated, no duplicates).
   - If status was "rss_published", change to "platforms_posting".
   - Update PlatformHealth: set lastSuccessAt, increment successCount24h.
   - If platformsCompleted >= platformsTargeted and platformsTargeted > 0, update status to "complete".
   - Return 200 with updated ContentItem.

5. POST /api/webhooks/platform-failed
   Purpose: Pabbly or RSSground calls this when a platform post fails.
   Request body:
   {
     "contentId": "string, required",
     "platform": "string, required",
     "errorMessage": "string, optional",
     "willRetry": "boolean, optional, default false",
     "failedBy": "string, optional — rssground | pabbly | followr_ubot | robomotion | manual"
   }
   Logic:
   - Find ContentItem by id. Return 404 if not found.
   - Create DistributionLog entry with status "failed" or "retrying".
   - Increment ContentItem errorCount.
   - Update PlatformHealth: set lastFailureAt, increment errors24h.
     - errors24h >= 3: set status "degraded"
     - errors24h >= 10: set status "down"
   - Create Alert:
     - willRetry true: severity "warning"
     - willRetry false: severity "critical"
     - Include content title, platform, and error message
   - Return 200 with updated ContentItem.

6. POST /api/webhooks/pipeline-complete
   Purpose: Pabbly calls this to mark content as fully distributed. Also used to update platformsTargeted without immediately completing (e.g., when Pabbly knows how many platforms will be targeted but Ubot hasn't finished posting yet).
   Request body:
   {
     "contentId": "string, required",
     "platformsTargeted": "number, optional — updates the target count",
     "forceComplete": "boolean, optional, default true — if true, sets status to 'complete' immediately. If false, only updates platformsTargeted and lets auto-complete logic in platform-posted handle the status transition."
   }
   Logic:
   - Find ContentItem by id. Return 404 if not found.
   - Update platformsTargeted if provided.
   - If forceComplete is true (default): set status to "complete".
   - If forceComplete is false: do NOT change status. The item will auto-complete when platformsCompleted >= platformsTargeted via platform-posted webhooks.
   - Return 200 with updated ContentItem.

7. POST /api/webhooks/pipeline-failed
   Purpose: Pabbly calls this on critical pipeline failure.
   Request body:
   {
     "contentId": "string, required",
     "errorMessage": "string, optional"
   }
   Logic:
   - Find ContentItem by id. Return 404 if not found.
   - Set status to "failed".
   - Create critical Alert.
   - Return 200 with updated ContentItem.

8. POST /api/webhooks/translation-received
   Purpose: Pabbly calls this when a translated version arrives.
   Request body:
   {
     "title": "string, required",
     "contentType": "string, required",
     "language": "string, required — target language code",
     "sourceUrl": "string, optional",
     "parentContentId": "string, required — the original English content",
     "platformsTargeted": "number, optional — total platforms this translation will be posted to"
   }
   Logic:
   - Auto-determine tier: check if this language has a Tier 1 RSSground feed for this content type. If yes, tier1. If no, tier2.
   - Create ContentItem linked to parent, set platformsTargeted if provided.
   - Return 200 with created ContentItem.

9. POST /api/webhooks/rssground/posting-fired
   Purpose: RSSground's webhook integration calls this when one of its posting campaigns fires. The payload format is different from Pabbly's — RSSground sends its own structure.
   Request body (RSSground webhook format):
   {
     "title": "string — the post title",
     "description": "string — the post content/description",
     "link": "string — the link URL",
     "image": "string, optional — image URL",
     "feed_title": "string — the name of the RSSground feed",
     "feed_url": "string — the RSSground feed URL"
   }
   Logic:
   - This is an inbound notification that RSSground posted something.
   - Look up the corresponding RssFeed record by matching the payload's `feed_url` against RssFeed.feedUrl.
   - Try to match to an existing ContentItem by title (case-insensitive partial match on ContentItem.title).
   - If matched: create a DistributionLog entry with platform "rssground" and status "success".
   - If not matched: create a new ContentItem with status "rss_published", tier "tier1_rssground", and a DistributionLog entry. This handles cases where content was added directly in RSSground without going through the Pabbly pipeline. Set the language from the matched RssFeed record if found, otherwise default to "en".
   - Update the matched RssFeed record's lastUpdatedAt and itemCount (if found).
   - Return 200.

UTILITY ENDPOINTS:

POST /api/cron/aggregate-metrics
- Count ContentItems created today, completed today, failed today
- Count DistributionLog successes today, broken down by tier (based on ContentItem tier)
- Calculate average latency for completed items today
- Create/update PipelineMetric for today
- Reset all PlatformHealth errors24h and successCount24h to 0
- Check for stale Tier 1 feeds (not updated in 5+ days) and create "feed_stale" alerts
- Check TierCapacity and create/update capacity warnings

POST /api/alerts/dismiss — accepts { "alertId": "string" }, sets isDismissed to true
POST /api/alerts/dismiss-all — dismisses all non-critical active alerts

GET /api/tier-capacity
- Returns TierCapacity records with calculated percentages
- Includes: total, used, reserved, available, percentUsed for each tier

TESTING:
After building all endpoints, test each one with curl commands. Test at minimum:
1. Create a Tier 1 content item via content-received
2. Mark it as queued via content-queued
3. Create a Tier 2 derivative via content-received with isDerivative true
4. Mark the Tier 1 item as RSS published via rss-published with feedSource "rssground"
5. Post to two platforms via platform-posted
6. Fail one platform via platform-failed
7. Complete the pipeline via pipeline-complete
8. Test pipeline-complete with forceComplete false (should update platformsTargeted without changing status)
9. Test the RSSground webhook at /api/webhooks/rssground/posting-fired
10. Check tier-capacity endpoint
11. Verify alerts were created for the failure

Show me all the curl commands I can use to test each endpoint.
```

## SESSION 3: Dashboard — Layout and Pipeline Overview

### What This Session Builds
- Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
- Main pipeline overview with tier-aware stats
- Tier 1 capacity gauge
- Content items table with tier indicators
- Auto-refresh

### Prompt for Claude Code

```
Now build the dashboard frontend. Read through the existing Prisma schema and webhook API routes first — the dashboard displays data from the same database.

LAYOUT:
Create a dashboard layout at /dashboard with:
- A sidebar on the left (240px wide, dark navy background #1B2A4A) with navigation links:
  - "Pipeline" (icon: activity) — main overview
  - "Content" (icon: file) — full content list
  - "Platforms" (icon: share/network) — platform health
  - "RSS Feeds" (icon: rss) — feed management with tier breakdown
  - "Metrics" (icon: bar-chart) — analytics
  - "Alerts" (icon: bell) — with red badge showing count of active undismissed alerts
  - "Settings" (icon: gear) — configuration
- Sidebar title: "Distribution Dashboard" with a small subtitle "Four-Tier Architecture"
- Below the navigation links, add a compact "Tier 1 Capacity" widget in the sidebar:
  - A small progress bar showing used/total (e.g., "87/150")
  - Color: green if under 70%, amber if 70-85%, red if over 85%
  - This is always visible so the operator never forgets how many Tier 1 slots remain
- Use Lucide React icons
- Main content area: light gray background (#F8FAFC)
- Responsive: mobile gets hamburger menu

DASHBOARD API ROUTES:

GET /api/dashboard/stats
Returns:
{
  "today": {
    "received": number,
    "inProgress": number,
    "completed": number,
    "failed": number
  },
  "pipeline": {
    "received": number (current items with this status),
    "queued": number,
    "rss_published": number,
    "platforms_posting": number,
    "complete": number (last 24h),
    "failed": number (last 24h)
  },
  "tiers": {
    "tier1": { "itemsToday": number, "feedsActive": number, "feedsTotal": 150, "feedsUsed": number },
    "tier2": { "itemsToday": number, "feedsActive": number },
    "tier3": { "postsToday": number }
  },
  "activeAlerts": number
}
Note: Tier 4 is deliberately excluded from pipeline overview stats and the tier distribution row. Tier 4 operates independently with no dashboard tracking (fingerprint isolation). Tier 4 estimated post counts appear only on the Metrics page (stacked area chart) and the Platform Health page (syndication summary panel).

GET /api/dashboard/content?status=all&language=all&type=all&tier=all&page=1&limit=20
Returns paginated content items with distribution logs.

GET /api/dashboard/recent-activity
Returns 15 most recently updated content items.

PIPELINE OVERVIEW PAGE (/dashboard):

TOP ROW — five stat cards:
1. "Received Today" — count, blue accent
2. "In Progress" — count, amber accent
3. "Completed Today" — count, green accent
4. "Failed" — count, red accent (red styling only if count > 0)
5. "Tier 1 Capacity" — show "87/150 used" with a mini progress bar inside the card. Color-coded green/amber/red based on percentage. This card is slightly wider than the others to accommodate the progress bar.

TIER DISTRIBUTION ROW — below stat cards:
Three compact cards side by side showing today's activity by tier:
1. "Tier 1 — RSSground" with a gold/amber left border accent, showing: X items published today, Y feeds active
2. "Tier 2 — External" with a blue left border accent, showing: X items published today, Y feeds active
3. "Tier 3 — Platforms" with a gray left border accent, showing: X posts distributed today

These give the operator instant awareness of which tier is doing the most work.

PIPELINE VISUALIZATION — below tier row:
Horizontal flow diagram showing stages left to right:
  Received → Queued → RSS Published → Platforms Posting → Complete

Each stage is a card showing:
- Stage name
- Count of items currently in that stage
- Small colored indicator (blue → blue → green → amber → green)
- Arrows/connecting lines between stages
- "Failed" as a separate card below the flow in red, connected to any stage

Inside the "RSS Published" stage card, show a small breakdown: "T1: X | T2: Y" so the operator can see how many went to Tier 1 vs Tier 2 feeds.

RECENT ACTIVITY TABLE — below pipeline:
Table of 15 most recent content items:
- Columns: Title, Type (badge), Language (badge), Tier (badge — gold for T1, blue for T2, gray for T3), Status (colored badge), Platforms (X/Y format), Last Updated (relative time)
- Clicking a row opens a slide-out panel showing:
  - Full content details including tier assignment
  - Distribution log with tool context (which entries went through RSSground, Followr/Ubot, Pabbly, or Robomotion)
  - Visual checklist of platforms with status indicators
  - If Tier 1: show which RSSground feed this was published to
  - If Tier 2: show which external feed was used
  - Tool attribution on each platform post: "via Followr (Ubot)", "via Pabbly", "via Robomotion", or "via RSSground"

AUTO-REFRESH:
Every 30 seconds. Use SWR or React Query. Show "Last updated: X seconds ago" in top right.

STYLING:
- Clean, professional. Not overly colorful.
- Primary navy (#1B2A4A) for headers and sidebar
- Accent blue (#2E75B6) for interactive elements
- Tier 1 accent: gold/amber (#D4A843) — used for badges and border accents on Tier 1 items
- Tier 2 accent: blue (#2E75B6) — used for Tier 2 badges
- Tier 3 accent: gray (#6B7280) — used for Tier 3 badges
- White cards on light gray background
- Subtle shadows (shadow-sm)
- Status badges: green for complete, amber for in-progress, red for failed, blue for received
- Inter or system font stack

Make sure everything works with seed data. When I go to /dashboard, I should see a fully populated, professional pipeline overview with tier awareness.
```

CONTENT DETAIL (slide-out panel):

HEADER:
- Title (large)
- Tier badge (prominent) + Status badge
- Timestamps

TIER CONTEXT SECTION (new — this is important):
- If Tier 1: "Published to RSSground" with feed name and URL (clickable). Show a small "Tier 1 — Protected" label in gold.
- If Tier 2: "Published to External Feed" with feed source and URL. Show "Tier 2 — Expansion" label in blue.
- If Tier 3: "Platform-only distribution" with note "No RSS feed — platform posts only". Show "Tier 3 — Discovery" label in gray.

INFO GRID:
- Content Type, Language, Source URL, Error Count, Tier, Feed Source

DISTRIBUTION TIMELINE:
Vertical timeline showing the content's journey:

  - Status badge
  - "via Followr (Ubot)" or "via Pabbly" or "via Robomotion" or "via RSSground" label (based on DistributionLog data or PlatformHealth managedBy)
  - Post URL (if success)
  - Error message (if failed)
  - Timestamp
- "Complete" or "Failed" — final timestamp

DERIVATIVES SECTION (parent content only):
Mini-table of derivatives: title, derivative type, language, tier, status.

Everything should work with seed data. Loading skeletons while data loads.
```

## SESSION 5: Platform Health Page

### What This Session Builds
- Platform health grid grouped by management tool (Followr/Ubot, Pabbly, Robomotion, RSSground)
- Per-platform detail with tier and tool context
- Enable/disable controls

### Prompt for Claude Code

```
Build the Platforms page at /dashboard/platforms. Shows health of every distribution platform, grouped by which tool manages them.

Read existing codebase first.

API ROUTES:

GET /api/dashboard/platforms
Returns all PlatformHealth records enriched with:
- recentLogs: last 10 DistributionLog entries for this platform
- todayStats: { success, failed, pending } for today
- Last 7 days of daily post counts for sparkline
- Group by managedBy field (rssground, followr_ubot, pabbly, robomotion, manual)
- Also group by category for display

PUT /api/dashboard/platforms/:platformName
Updates platform config. Accepts: { isEnabled, notes, status }
Requires x-api-key authentication.

PAGE LAYOUT:

SUMMARY BAR:
- Four counters: "X Active", "Y Degraded", "Z Down", "W Disabled" with colored dots
- Toggle: "Show disabled platforms"

GROUPED SECTIONS:

Section 1: "Managed by Followr via Ubot Studio" with a Followr icon
Subtitle: "Social platforms posted to via Followr's scheduling UI, automated by Ubot Studio browser bot"
Show platform cards for: facebook, instagram, x_twitter, linkedin, pinterest, tiktok, youtube, medium
These are the platforms Followr handles. Ubot Studio logs into Followr and schedules posts automatically.

Section 2: "Managed by Pabbly Connect" with a Pabbly icon
Subtitle: "Messaging and blog platforms posted to via Pabbly Connect workflows"
Show platform cards for: whatsapp, telegram, wordpress, blogger, substack, mastodon, github, internet_archive, cloudflare_pages

Section 3: "Managed by Robomotion" with a Robomotion/bot icon
Subtitle: "Edge-case platforms automated via Robomotion browser bot"
Show platform cards for: rumble, odysee, signal
These are platforms neither Followr nor Pabbly can reach — Robomotion logs in and posts directly.

Section 4: "RSS Distribution" with an RSS icon
Subtitle: "Tier 1 and Tier 2 feed infrastructure"
Show a single special card for "rssground" platform:
- Instead of a regular platform card, show:
  - "RSSground Feeds" title
  - Tier 1 capacity bar (87/150)
  - Last successful feed update
  - Feeds updated today count
  - Status indicator

Section 5: "Tier 4 — IFTTT Syndication Network" with a broadcast/scatter icon
Subtitle: "Fingerprint-free amplification layer — not individually tracked"
This is NOT a list of platform cards like the other sections. It's a summary panel:
- "Syndication Network Overview" card with:
  - Estimated satellite accounts: ~200 (configurable in settings)
  - Languages active: 5 (English, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, Tamil)
  - Content streams: "IFTTT Autopilot (text + images)" and "Ubot Native Upload (video + audio)"
  - Estimated daily posts: tier4EstimatedPosts from latest PipelineMetric
  - Status: "Operating Independently" with a green indicator
  - Small info callout: "Tier 4 operates outside the dashboard by design. No webhooks, no tracking, no digital trail. IFTTT watches RSS feeds and auto-distributes. Ubot batch-uploads high-value media. See /dashboard/docs for setup details."
- This section should have a distinctly different visual treatment — more muted, with a subtle border pattern or background that communicates "this exists but is deliberately arms-length"

PLATFORM CARD (for each platform):
- Platform icon with brand-ish color accent
- Platform display name
- "via Followr (Ubot)" or "via Pabbly" or "via Robomotion" subtle label
- Status indicator (colored dot + text)
- Last successful post (relative time)
- Today's stats: "42 posted, 2 failed"
- Mini sparkline (7 days, Recharts)
- Auth expiry warning badge if within 14 days

Sort within each section: degraded/down first, then active by recent activity, disabled last.

PLATFORM DETAIL (slide-out on click):

HEADER:
- Platform icon + name + status badge
- "Managed by: Followr (Ubot) / Pabbly / Robomotion / RSSground" label
- Enabled toggle
- Notes text field (inline editable)

STATS:
- Today: X successful, Y failed, Z pending
- 24h error rate
- Auth expires date

RECENT ACTIVITY TABLE:
Last 20 distribution logs for this platform.
- Content title, tier badge, status, post URL, error message, timestamp

7-DAY CHART:
Bar chart: green (success) and red (failed) stacked per day.

ACTIONS:
- "Clear Errors" button
- "View All Content" — links to Content page filtered to this platform

Make it look good with seed data. Instagram should stand out as degraded. The RSSground section should feel distinct and premium since it's the Tier 1 infrastructure. The Followr/Ubot section should be the largest group since it handles the most social platforms. The Robomotion section should feel like a small, specialized outpost for edge cases. The Tier 4 syndication section should feel deliberately detached — present but clearly operating outside the dashboard's control, like a weather report for something happening elsewhere.

## SESSION 6: RSS Feeds Page

### What This Session Builds
- RSS feed management organized by tier
- Tier 1 capacity management with allocation tracking
- Feed health monitoring
- Tier promotion workflow (promoting a language from Tier 2 to Tier 1)

### Prompt for Claude Code

```
Build the RSS Feeds page at /dashboard/feeds. This is the strategic nerve center for feed management — organized by tier with capacity tracking.

Read existing codebase first.

API ROUTES:

GET /api/dashboard/feeds
Returns all RssFeed records with:
- "health" indicator: "healthy" if lastUpdatedAt within 48 hours, "stale" if 2-7 days, "inactive" if 7+ days or never
- Grouped by tier, then by language
- Include TierCapacity data

GET /api/tier-capacity (already built in Session 2, ensure it works)

POST /api/dashboard/feeds/create
Creates a new RssFeed record. Accepts:
{
  "tier": "tier1_rssground | tier2_external",
  "feedSource": "rssground | ghost | cloudflare | custom | other",
  "language": "string",
  "languageDisplayName": "string",
  "contentType": "string",
  "feedUrl": "string",
  "rssgroundFeedId": "string, optional"
}
If tier is tier1_rssground, increment TierCapacity usedSlots.
If TierCapacity would exceed totalSlots, return 400 with error "Tier 1 capacity exceeded".

POST /api/dashboard/feeds/:id/promote
Promotes a Tier 2 feed to Tier 1. Changes tier to "tier1_rssground", updates feedSource.
Checks capacity first. Returns 400 if no Tier 1 slots available.

PAGE LAYOUT:

TIER CAPACITY HEADER (full width, prominent):
Two capacity cards side by side:

Card 1: "Tier 1 — RSSground Feeds"
- Large progress bar: 87/150 used
- Color: green/amber/red based on percentage
- Breakdown below: "Used: 87 | Reserved: 13 | Available: 50"
- "Available" should be prominent — this is how many new languages can get Tier 1 feeds
- Small text: "Tier 1 feeds are protected depth/discipleship content hosted on RSSground"

Card 2: "Tier 2 — External Feeds"
- Count of active Tier 2 feeds: 24
- Feed sources breakdown: "Ghost: 13 | Cloudflare: 6 | Other: 5"
- Small text: "Tier 2 feeds are expansion content on external hosting"

VIEW TOGGLE:
"By Tier" (default) | "By Language" | "All Feeds"

BY TIER VIEW (default):

TIER 1 SECTION:
- Gold/amber header bar: "Tier 1 — RSSground" with capacity badge "87/150"
- Organized by language, each language as a collapsible section:
  - Header: flag emoji + language name + code + feed count
  - Expanded: mini-table of feeds for that language:
    - Content Type
    - Feed URL (truncated) with copy button
    - Items count
    - Subscribers estimate
    - Last Updated (health-colored: green/amber/red)
    - Status badge
- English expanded by default, others collapsed
- Sort languages by feed count descending

TIER 2 SECTION:
- Blue header bar: "Tier 2 — External" with count badge
- Same language grouping structure
- Additional column: Feed Source (Ghost, Cloudflare, Custom, etc.)
- For languages that exist in Tier 2 but NOT in Tier 1: show a subtle "⬆ Promote to Tier 1" button next to the language header. Clicking opens a confirmation dialog:
  - "Promote [Language] to Tier 1?"
  - "This will allocate X Tier 1 RSSground slot(s) for [Language]."
  - "Current Tier 1 availability: Y slots"
  - Confirm / Cancel buttons
  - On confirm: calls the promote API

BY LANGUAGE VIEW:
For each language, show both Tier 1 and Tier 2 feeds together:
- Language header with flag + name
- Feeds listed with tier badge (T1 gold, T2 blue) next to each
- Makes it easy to see: "Hindi has 4 Tier 1 feeds and 2 Tier 2 feeds"

ALL FEEDS VIEW:
Flat table with all feeds. Columns: Tier (badge), Language, Content Type, Feed Source, Feed URL (copy), Items, Subscribers, Last Updated, Health, Status. Sortable. Searchable.

FEED DETAIL (click to expand or modal):
- Full feed URL (selectable, copy button)
- QR code for feed URL (for field leaders to scan and subscribe)
- Tier badge (prominent)
- Feed source
- RSSground Feed ID (if Tier 1)
- Subscriber estimate
- Item count
- Created date, last updated
- Health status with explanation
- One-click subscribe links (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, Feedly, Inoreader)
- If Tier 2: "Promote to Tier 1" button

EMPTY STATE / NEW FEED:
- An "Add Feed" button in each tier section
- Opens a form to register a new feed (calls POST /api/dashboard/feeds/create)
- If adding Tier 1: show remaining capacity prominently in the form

Make sure this page looks polished with seed data. The Tier 1 section should feel like the premium, protected layer. The Tier 2 section should feel like the flexible expansion layer. The capacity bar should be impossible to miss.
```

## SESSION 7: Metrics and Alerts Pages

### What This Session Builds
- Metrics dashboard with tier-aware charts
- Alerts management with tier context
- Telegram notification integration

### Prompt for Claude Code

```
Build Metrics (/dashboard/metrics) and Alerts (/dashboard/alerts) pages.

Read existing codebase first.

API ROUTES:

GET /api/dashboard/metrics?days=14
Returns:
{
  "daily": PipelineMetric[] for last N days (includes tier1Posts, tier2Posts, tier3Posts),
  "totals": {
    "totalContent": count all ContentItems,
    "totalDistributed": count with status "complete",
    "totalPlatformPosts": sum all successful DistributionLog entries,
    "totalLanguages": distinct languages in ContentItems,
    "totalFeeds": count RssFeeds,
    "tier1Feeds": count where tier is tier1_rssground,
    "tier2Feeds": count where tier is tier2_external
  },
  "platformBreakdown": { platform: count }[] — successful posts per platform all-time,
  "languageBreakdown": { language: count }[] — content per language,
  "contentTypeBreakdown": { contentType: count }[],
  "tierBreakdown": { tier: count }[] — content per tier,
  "averageLatency": number
}

GET /api/dashboard/alerts?status=active
Returns Alert records. Status: "active", "dismissed", "all".

POST /api/dashboard/alerts/dismiss — { alertId: string }
POST /api/dashboard/alerts/dismiss-all — dismisses all non-critical

METRICS PAGE:

TOP ROW — five summary cards:
1. "Total Content Processed" — all-time
2. "Total Platform Posts" — all-time
3. "Languages Active" — count
4. "Avg Pipeline Latency" — formatted "18 min"
5. "Tier 1 Feed Utilization" — "87/150 (58%)" with mini progress bar

CHART ROW 1 (full width):
"Pipeline Activity — Last 14 Days"
Combined line chart with three lines:
- Content Received (blue)
- Content Completed (green)
- Content Failed (red, dashed)

CHART ROW 2 (full width — NEW tier-specific chart):
"Distribution by Tier — Last 14 Days"
Stacked area chart showing tier1Posts, tier2Posts, tier3Posts, tier4EstimatedPosts per day.
- Tier 1: gold/amber fill
- Tier 2: blue fill
- Tier 3: gray fill
- Tier 4: muted purple fill (dashed line border to indicate "estimated")
This shows the operator how distribution load is split across tiers over time. Tier 4 should dwarf the other tiers (hundreds of satellite posts per content item). Add a toggle to show/hide Tier 4 since its scale may compress the other tiers visually. When Tier 4 is hidden, the chart should rescale to show Tiers 1-3 detail clearly. Add a small "(estimated)" label on the Tier 4 legend entry.

CHART ROW 3 (two charts side by side):

Left: "Posts by Platform"
Horizontal bar chart. Group bars by management tool:
- Followr/Ubot-managed platforms in one color family
- Pabbly-managed platforms in another
- Robomotion-managed platforms in a third
- Do NOT include Tier 4 satellite accounts here (they're not tracked individually)
Show count at end of each bar.

Right: "Content by Language"
Horizontal bar chart, sorted by count.

CHART ROW 4 (two charts side by side):

Left: "Content Type Distribution"
Donut chart with four segments.

Right: "Tier Distribution"
Donut chart with three segments (Tier 1 gold, Tier 2 blue, Tier 3 gray). Shows content split across Tiers 1-3 only. Tier 4 estimated posts are shown in the stacked area chart above — not repeated here, because Tier 4's scale would make Tiers 1-3 invisible in a donut chart. Add a small footnote: "Tier 4 syndication estimates shown in area chart above."

CHART ROW 5 (full width):
"Pipeline Latency Trend"
Line chart: avg latency per day, last 14 days.
Reference line at 30 minutes labeled "Target".
Green when below, red when above.

ALERTS PAGE:

TOP BAR:
- "Alerts" title
- Filter tabs: "Active (X)" | "Dismissed" | "All"
- "Dismiss All Non-Critical" button

ALERT LIST (vertical cards):
Each card:
- Left colored stripe: red (critical), amber (warning), blue (info)
- Alert icon matching type:
  - platform_down: server icon
  - auth_expiring: key/shield icon
  - distribution_failed: x-circle icon
  - content_stuck: clock icon
  - high_error_rate: alert-triangle icon
  - tier1_capacity_warning: database/layers icon (NEW)
  - feed_stale: rss icon (NEW)
- Title (bold)
- Message
- Metadata: severity badge + type badge + timestamp
- Tier context: if the alert relates to Tier 1 content or feeds, show a gold "Tier 1" badge. This makes Tier 1 issues visually urgent.
- Related links: platform page, content item, feed page
- Actions: "Dismiss" button. "View Content" for distribution failures. "View Feed" for feed_stale alerts. "View Capacity" for tier1_capacity_warning (links to feeds page).

tier1_capacity_warning alerts should have gold left border (matching Tier 1 accent) instead of the standard severity color. These are strategic alerts, not errors.

Dismissed alerts: grayed out with "Dismissed at [time]".

TELEGRAM NOTIFICATIONS:
Create /lib/telegram.ts:
- POST https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/sendMessage
- Reads TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID from env
- parse_mode "HTML"
- If env vars not set, log warning and skip

Integrate into webhook API:
- platform-failed (critical, willRetry false): "<b>🔴 Distribution Failed</b>\nPlatform: {platform}\nContent: {title}\nTier: {tier}\nManaged by: {managedBy}\nError: {errorMessage}"
- Platform status changes to "down": "<b>🔴 Platform Down: {platform}</b>\n{errors24h} errors in 24h\nManaged by: {managedBy}"
- Tier 1 capacity warning (when crossing 80%): "<b>⚠️ Tier 1 Capacity Alert</b>\n{used}/150 RSSground feeds allocated ({percent}%)\nAvailable: {available} slots"
- Feed stale (Tier 1 only): "<b>⚠️ Tier 1 Feed Stale</b>\nFeed: {feedUrl}\nLanguage: {language}\nLast updated: {lastUpdatedAt}"

Add TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID to .env.example with instructions.

Make both pages look polished with seed data. The tier distribution chart should clearly show the four-tier strategy in action, with Tier 4 estimated posts dwarfing the other tiers to visually communicate the syndication amplification effect.
```

## SESSION 8: Settings Page

### What This Session Builds
- Settings/configuration page with tier management
- Webhook URL reference section
- Notification settings
- System info

### Prompt for Claude Code

```
Build the Settings page at /dashboard/settings. This is the operator's configuration hub.

Read entire codebase first.

API ROUTES:

GET /api/dashboard/settings
Returns:
{
  "tierCapacity": TierCapacity records,
  "tierAllocation": { language: string, contentTypes: string[] }[] — derived from RssFeed records grouped by language for Tier 1,
  "platformConfig": PlatformHealth records,
  "syndicationConfig": {
    "estimatedAccounts": number (from env or config),
    "networkMultiplier": number,
    "activeLanguages": string[],
    "lastAuditDate": string
  },
  "system": {
    "contentItems": count,
    "distributionLogs": count,
    "tier1Feeds": count,
    "tier2Feeds": count,
    "alerts": count,
    "dbSizeBytes": number,
    "appVersion": string,
    "uptime": string
  }
}

PUT /api/dashboard/settings/tier-capacity
Accepts: { "reservedSlots": number }
Updates TierCapacity reservedSlots for tier1_rssground.
Requires x-api-key authentication.

PUT /api/dashboard/settings/syndication
Accepts: { "estimatedAccounts": number, "networkMultiplier": number, "activeLanguages": string[], "lastAuditDate": string }
Stores in a simple JSON config file or a new Settings table.
Requires x-api-key authentication.

Note on authentication: All dashboard GET routes (stats, content, platforms, feeds, metrics, alerts, settings) are unauthenticated — the dashboard is intended to run on a private network or behind a reverse proxy. All webhook routes (/api/webhooks/*) require x-api-key because they're called by external systems over the internet. Dashboard PUT/POST routes that modify data (/api/dashboard/platforms/:platformName, /api/dashboard/feeds/create, /api/dashboard/feeds/:id/promote, /api/dashboard/settings/*) also require x-api-key as a safety measure against accidental modification. Apply this consistently across all existing and new write endpoints.

SETTINGS PAGE (/dashboard/settings):

SECTION 1: Tier 1 Capacity Management
- Prominent capacity bar: 87/150 used
- Table showing allocation breakdown:
  | Language | Sermons | Teachings | Articles | Study Guides | Total Feeds |
  Show each language with checkmarks for which content types have Tier 1 feeds
- "Reserved Slots" control: let operator set how many slots to keep in reserve (currently 13). This prevents accidentally allocating all 150.
- Warning text: "Reserved slots cannot be allocated until the reserve is reduced. This protects capacity for emerging languages identified through field reports."

SECTION 2: Platform Configuration
- Table of all platforms: Platform Name, Managed By (Followr/Ubot, Pabbly, Robomotion, RSSground, IFTTT/Ubot Syndication badge), Status, Enabled toggle, Auth Expires, Notes (inline editable)
- Group by management tool (Followr/Ubot section, Pabbly section, Robomotion section, RSSground section)
- Separate "Tier 4 Syndication" section at bottom — not a table of individual accounts (there are hundreds), but a configuration panel:
  - Estimated satellite accounts (editable number, default 200)
  - Network multiplier (how many posts per RSS item, default 75 for a 2-ring network)
  - Languages with active networks (multi-select from available languages)
  - "Last IFTTT audit date" (date field — when you last verified applets are still running)
  - Note: "These numbers are used to calculate Tier 4 estimated posts in the Metrics page. Actual post counts are not tracked by the dashboard."

SECTION 3: Webhook Configuration
- Display base URL
- Two subsections:

  "For Pabbly Connect Workflows:"
  List each Pabbly webhook endpoint with full URL, copy button, method, description.

  "For RSSground Integration:"
  List the RSSground-specific endpoint: /api/webhooks/rssground/posting-fired
  Show the RSSground webhook key (masked, with reveal toggle)
  Instructions: "In RSSground, go to your Integration Posting Campaign → select Webhook as posting destination → paste this URL"

SECTION 4: Notification Settings
- Telegram config status (green/red indicators for bot token and chat ID)
- "Send Test Message" button
- Setup instructions for Telegram bot

SECTION 5: System Info
- Database counts: content items, distribution logs, feeds (by tier), alerts
- Database size
- App version
- Uptime

Make the Settings page clean and functional with seed data. The Tier 1 allocation table should make it immediately clear which languages have which feeds.
```

## SESSION 9: Documentation Page

### What This Session Builds
- Webhook documentation page with complete API reference
- Setup guides for Pabbly, RSSground, Followr/Ubot, Robomotion, and IFTTT syndication
- Pabbly workflow step-by-step guides
- Google Drive folder structure reference
- Testing checklist

### Prompt for Claude Code

```
Build the Documentation page at /dashboard/docs. This is the operator's reference when setting up Pabbly, RSSground, Ubot Studio, Robomotion, and the Tier 4 syndication network.

Read entire codebase first — especially the webhook API routes in /api/webhooks/*.

This page has a LOT of content. Use a left-side table of contents (anchor links) for navigation within the page. Each Part should be a section with a clear heading and anchor. The page should feel like professional API documentation — syntax-highlighted code blocks, clear sections, easy to scan and copy from.

IMPORTANT: This page renders static documentation content. Do NOT fetch this content from an API — hardcode it directly in the React component using the webhook route definitions from the codebase. Read the actual API route files to get accurate endpoint paths, request schemas, and response formats.

PART 1: "Pabbly Connect Webhook Reference"
For each webhook endpoint, show:
- Endpoint URL + copy button
- Method (POST)
- Required headers (Content-Type: application/json, x-api-key)
- Request body schema with field descriptions, required vs optional
- Example request body (valid JSON, copy-pasteable)
- Example success response
- Example error response
- Special notes

Include ALL webhook endpoints — read them from the codebase:
1. POST /api/webhooks/content-received — note the platformsTargeted field and auto-completion behavior
2. POST /api/webhooks/content-queued
3. POST /api/webhooks/rss-published
4. POST /api/webhooks/platform-posted — note this increments platformsCompleted toward auto-completion
5. POST /api/webhooks/platform-failed
6. POST /api/webhooks/pipeline-complete — document the forceComplete flag (true = immediate complete, false = just set target)
7. POST /api/webhooks/pipeline-failed
8. POST /api/webhooks/translation-received — note platformsTargeted field
9. POST /api/webhooks/rssground/posting-fired — note different auth key and payload format
10. POST /api/cron/aggregate-metrics

For each endpoint, read the actual route handler code to get the exact field names, types, and validation rules. Don't guess — use what's in the codebase.

PART 2: "RSSground Webhook Setup"
Step-by-step guide:
1. Go to RSSground → Create Integration Posting Campaign
2. Add your content feeds to the campaign
3. In Posting Destination, select "Webhook"
4. Paste your dashboard webhook URL: {baseUrl}/api/webhooks/rssground/posting-fired
5. Add the x-api-key header with your RSSGROUND_WEBHOOK_KEY value
6. The dashboard will automatically log every post RSSground makes
7. Note: "RSSground sends its own payload format (title, description, link, image, feed_title, feed_url). The dashboard normalizes it automatically."
8. Important: "RSSground is used ONLY for Tier 1 RSS feed management. Social posting is handled by Followr via Ubot Studio."

PART 3: "Followr + Ubot Studio Setup Guide"

Overview text:
"Followr handles social media posting to Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, YouTube, and Medium. Since Followr doesn't have an RSS import feature, we use Ubot Studio to automate posting. Ubot logs into Followr's web UI and schedules posts like a human operator would — at zero additional monthly cost."

Setup Steps:
1. Create a "Followr Queue" folder in Google Drive (inside Distribution Intake) with Pending/, Completed/, Failed/ subfolders
2. In Pabbly, after content is published to RSS, add a step that creates a JSON file in the Followr Queue/Pending/ folder. Show this example JSON:
   { "contentId": "cuid from dashboard", "title": "Post title", "caption": "Post caption/description", "mediaUrl": "URL to image or video", "platforms": ["facebook", "instagram", "x_twitter", "linkedin"], "tags": ["sermon", "hindi"], "scheduleTime": "ISO datetime or next_optimal", "dashboardWebhookUrl": "{baseUrl}/api/webhooks/platform-posted", "dashboardApiKey": "your-webhook-api-key" }
3. Build a Ubot Studio bot that monitors the folder, reads each JSON, logs into Followr, creates posts, calls dashboard webhooks (platform-posted for each platform on success, platform-failed on failure), and moves JSON files to Completed/ or Failed/
4. Ubot bot runs as standalone .exe on a Windows machine or VPS
5. Note: "When Followr updates its UI, the Ubot bot may need adjustment. Expect ~1-2 hours of maintenance per quarter."

PART 4: "Robomotion Setup Guide"

Overview text:
"Robomotion handles platforms that neither Followr nor Pabbly can reach: Rumble, Odysee, and Signal."

Setup Steps:
1. Create "Robomotion Queue" folder in Google Drive with Pending/, Completed/, Failed/
2. Pabbly drops posting instructions for Rumble/Odysee/Signal content into Pending/
3. Robomotion flows monitor the folder, post content, call dashboard webhooks with postedBy: "robomotion"
4. Note: "Lower priority than Followr/Ubot. Set up after core pipeline is working."

PART 5: "Tier 4 — IFTTT Syndication Network Setup Guide"

This is the longest section. Include:

**Overview: What Tier 4 Is**

Tier 4 is the Matthew 13 scattering layer — unbranded satellite accounts that cascade content across the digital landscape with zero fingerprints linking them to HQ. This section provides comprehensive, operator-ready guidance for building Tier 4 using Fiverr-based syndication network services.

Key characteristics:
- Hundreds of satellite accounts auto-posting from RSS feeds via IFTTT
- Ubot Studio for native video/audio uploads (platforms where IFTTT can't handle media)
- CC0 licensing makes unattributed distribution legally clean
- Deliberately excluded from dashboard tracking (fingerprint isolation)
- One-time setup investment (~$100/language), runs indefinitely with minimal maintenance

Purpose: If HQ disappears tomorrow, Tier 4 satellite accounts continue auto-posting indefinitely. This is resilience-through-decentralization.

**1. Understanding Syndication Network Architecture**

Explain the 2-tier cascading structure that creates 75-200+ posts from one RSS item:

**Ring 1 (Branded Ring): 15-20 accounts**
- Web 2.0 platforms: Tumblr, WordPress.com, Blogger, Medium
- Each account connects to your Tier 1 or Tier 2 RSS feed via IFTTT
- IFTTT applets auto-post when RSS updates (text + featured image)
- Each Ring 1 account generates its own RSS feed

**Ring 2 (Persona Rings): 60 accounts across 4 groups**
- Each persona group (15 accounts) connects to 4-5 Ring 1 RSS feeds via IFTTT
- Same platforms as Ring 1, distributed across groups
- Creates diversity: if Ring 1 has 5 sources, Ring 2 sees varied publishing patterns
- Personas are culturally appropriate (regional Indian names for Hindi/Tamil/Bengali content)

**Multiplication Effect:**
- 1 RSS item published → 15 Ring 1 accounts auto-post within 15-30 minutes (IFTTT polling)
- 15 Ring 1 posts generate 15 new RSS items → 60 Ring 2 accounts auto-post within 30-60 minutes
- Total reach: 1 source item → 75 distributed posts across 75 unconnected accounts
- Optional Ring 3 for premium networks: 200+ total posts per source item

**Why 2-Tier Cascading Matters:**
- Platform algorithms see 75 unique accounts sharing similar content organically
- Zero digital fingerprints linking accounts (different IPs, different IFTTT accounts, unique personas)
- If 20 accounts get suspended, 55 continue operating independently
- Content reaches audiences who would never find your branded channels

**Platform Mix Recommendations:**
- Tumblr: Best for visual content, allows NSFW (mature biblical topics), native video support
- WordPress.com: Professional appearance, built-in RSS, reliable IFTTT integration
- Blogger: Google-owned, stable API, unlimited free accounts
- Medium: High-quality readership, but restricts automation (use sparingly, monitor for suspensions)
- Write.as: Minimalist, privacy-focused alternative to Medium

**2. Finding & Evaluating Fiverr Sellers**

Provide detailed guidance on sourcing qualified sellers:

**Search Strategy:**

Primary search terms on Fiverr:
- "IFTTT syndication network"
- "web 2.0 properties"
- "RSS automation setup"
- "multi-tier blog network"

Alternative marketplaces:
- Upwork: search "IFTTT automation" or "syndication network"
- Legiit: SEO category → "web 2.0 properties" or "syndication network"

**Example Seller Reference:**
https://www.fiverr.com/rubenjsr/do-autopost-setup-for-your-website-or-youtube

Use this as reference for deliverable expectations (note: this is an example, not an endorsement — evaluate all sellers independently)

**Green Flags (Seller Selection Criteria):**
✅ Portfolio shows 10+ completed syndication networks
✅ Reviews mention "IFTTT setup," "automation," "RSS feeds"
✅ Seller explicitly offers "2-tier" or "multi-ring" networks
✅ Gig includes "master login spreadsheet" in deliverables
✅ Turnaround time: 3-7 days (realistic for 75-account manual setup)
✅ Communication: seller asks clarifying questions about your RSS feed format
✅ Seller understands "no backlinks, no attribution" when you explain it
✅ Seller offers post-delivery support (fixing broken IFTTT applets within 30 days)

**Red Flags (Avoid These Sellers):**
🚩 Gig focuses on "PBN" (Private Blog Network) with SEO/backlink emphasis
🚩 Promises "high DA/PA accounts" (you don't care about SEO metrics)
🚩 Uses templated personas (same bio across multiple accounts)
🚩 Turnaround under 24 hours for 75 accounts (likely using automation that creates fingerprints)
🚩 No mention of IFTTT credentials in deliverables
🚩 Seller doesn't understand RSS or asks for WordPress admin access
🚩 Reviews mention "banned accounts" or "suspended properties"
🚩 Pricing seems too cheap (<$50 for 75 accounts — indicates low quality)

**Critical Questions to Ask Before Ordering:**

1. "Do you create IFTTT applets that connect RSS feeds to Web 2.0 accounts?"
   - **Correct answer:** Yes, I set up IFTTT Pro/free applets for each account

2. "Will each Ring 2 account have a unique persona (name, bio, profile image)?"
   - **Correct answer:** Yes, I create unique personas for each account

3. "Can you ensure zero backlinks and zero source attribution in the auto-posts?"
   - **Correct answer:** Yes, IFTTT can post just title + excerpt + image without attribution

4. "What's included in the master login spreadsheet?"
   - **Correct answer:** Account URL, username, password, email, platform, IFTTT applet ID

5. "Do I get access to the IFTTT account(s) you create?"
   - **Correct answer:** Yes, I'll create separate IFTTT accounts and give you login credentials

6. "For Indian language content (Hindi/Bengali/Tamil), can you create regional personas?"
   - **Correct answer:** Yes, I'll use culturally appropriate names and bios

**Pricing Expectations:**
- 2-tier network (75 accounts): $80-$150 per language
- **Budget recommendation: $100/language as baseline**
- Total for 5 languages (English + Hindi/Bengali/Urdu/Tamil): $500
- Full 25-language coverage: $2,500
- Quarterly maintenance audit: $50 (2-3 hours to verify IFTTT applets still firing)

**3. The 7 Fingerprint-Free Configuration Rules (EXPANDED)**

When ordering your syndication network, provide sellers with these EXACT instructions. This section should be formatted as a copy-paste ready brief:

---

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FINGERPRINT-FREE SYNDICATION NETWORK:**

**Rule 1: Zero Backlinks**
- IFTTT applets must NOT include a link back to the source RSS feed
- Post template should be: {{EntryTitle}} + {{EntryContent}} (or excerpt) + {{EntryImageURL}}
- Do NOT use {{EntryUrl}} in the template
- Goal: Content appears to originate from the satellite account, not syndicated

**Rule 2: Zero Source Attribution**
- No "via [source]" or "originally published at" text
- No RSS feed branding in the post
- No "powered by IFTTT" badges (disable in IFTTT applet settings)
- Content should look native to each platform

**Rule 3: Unique Personas Per Account**
- Each satellite account gets a unique persona: name, bio, profile photo
- No duplicate personas across accounts
- No generic names like "user123" or "blogger456"
- Profile photos: use free stock photos or AI-generated faces (diverse, professional)

**Rule 4: Regional Personas for Indian Languages**
- Hindi content: accounts use Hindi/North Indian names (Priya Sharma, Raj Malhotra, Anjali Gupta)
- Bengali content: Bengali names (Ananya Chatterjee, Arjun Banerjee)
- Tamil content: Tamil names (Divya Rajan, Karthik Subramanian)
- Urdu content: Urdu/Muslim names (Fatima Khan, Hassan Ali)
- Telugu content: Telugu names (Lakshmi Reddy, Venkat Rao)
- Bios should reflect regional context (e.g., "Teacher from Kolkata sharing wisdom")

**Rule 5: Varied Post Templates**
- Don't use identical IFTTT post templates across all accounts
- Ring 1: some accounts post full content, others post excerpts
- Ring 2: vary the format (some use title as headline, others embed title in body)
- Timing variation: stagger IFTTT polling intervals (5 min, 15 min, 30 min) if IFTTT Pro allows

**Rule 6: IFTTT Applets Point to RSS Feed URLs Only**
- The ONLY connection between your infrastructure and satellite accounts is the RSS feed URL
- Do NOT link satellite accounts to your WordPress/Ghost admin
- Do NOT create accounts using your primary email domain
- Use separate email addresses for each satellite account (disposable/burner emails acceptable)

**Rule 7: Zero Traceability**
- Satellite accounts should have NO identifying information linking them to each other or to HQ
- Different account creation dates (spread over several days)
- Different profile images, different bios, different posting patterns
- If one account gets suspended, investigators find ZERO trail to the other 74 accounts

---

**DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS:**

You MUST provide:

1. **Master login spreadsheet** (Excel or Google Sheets) with columns:
   - Platform (WordPress.com, Tumblr, Blogger, Medium, etc.)
   - Account URL
   - Username
   - Password
   - Email address used
   - Ring (Ring 1 or Ring 2)
   - Persona name
   - IFTTT applet ID
   - RSS feed source (which Tier 1/2 feed this account follows)
   - Status (active, pending, suspended)
   - Notes

2. **IFTTT account credentials:**
   - Login email and password for IFTTT account(s) you created
   - Confirmation that all applets are active and firing

3. **Applet list:**
   - Screenshot or export of all IFTTT applets showing:
     - Source RSS feed
     - Target platform/account
     - Post template
     - Status: ON

4. **Public URLs for all satellite accounts:**
   - So operators can manually verify posts are appearing

5. **Firing confirmation:**
   - Test post proving IFTTT applets are working
   - Publish a test item to RSS feed, show that Ring 1 accounts auto-posted it, and Ring 2 accounts picked it up from Ring 1 feeds

**4. Step-by-Step Ordering Process**

Provide tactical guidance for placing Fiverr orders:

**Phase 1: Pre-Order Preparation**

Before ordering:
1. Ensure your Tier 1 or Tier 2 RSS feed is live and stable
   - Test feed URL in a browser: should return valid XML
   - Publish 2-3 test items so the feed has content
   - Verify feed includes: title, description/content, featured image URL

2. Create a dedicated email for receiving satellite account credentials
   - Option 1: Gmail alias (youremail+syndication@gmail.com)
   - Option 2: Separate ProtonMail account for security
   - This email will receive password reset requests, platform notifications

3. Document your RSS feed specifications:
   - Feed URL
   - Language
   - Content type (sermons, devotionals, articles)
   - Publishing frequency (daily, 3x/week, weekly)
   - Image format (do posts include featured images? Required for visual platforms)

**Phase 2: Place the Order**

1. Select your seller (use evaluation criteria from section 2)

2. Choose the gig tier:
   - Standard: 2-tier network, 75 accounts ($100-150)
   - Premium: 3-tier network, 150-200 accounts ($200-300) — usually overkill

3. In the order requirements text box, paste:
   - The 7 Fingerprint-Free Rules (from section 3)
   - Your RSS feed URL
   - Language for this network
   - Content niche description ("Biblical teachings, devotionals, Christian discipleship")
   - Deliverable checklist (from section 3)

4. Attach any reference materials:
   - Example post showing desired format
   - List of preferred platforms (if you have strong opinions)

5. Submit order and add to escrow

**Phase 3: Seller Communication**

1. Seller may ask clarifying questions — respond within 24 hours to avoid delays

2. Common questions and correct answers:
   - Q: "Do you want Ring 2 to follow all Ring 1 accounts or split them?"
     - A: "Split into 4 groups. Each group follows 4-5 Ring 1 accounts."
   - Q: "Should I create the IFTTT account or use yours?"
     - A: "Create a new IFTTT account and give me login credentials."
   - Q: "What email should I use for satellite accounts?"
     - A: "Use disposable emails or create emails specific to this network. Provide all credentials in the spreadsheet."

3. If seller seems confused about fingerprint-free requirements, reiterate key points from the 7 Rules

**Phase 4: Delivery & Verification**

Seller delivers the network (typically 5-7 days). Before accepting delivery:

1. **Verify master login spreadsheet:**
   - ✅ All 75 accounts listed with complete credentials
   - ✅ Ring 1/Ring 2 designation clear
   - ✅ IFTTT applet IDs included
   - ✅ No duplicate personas across accounts

2. **Verify IFTTT access:**
   - ✅ Log into IFTTT account with provided credentials
   - ✅ See all applets listed and status: ON
   - ✅ Applet templates match fingerprint-free rules (no backlinks, no attribution)

3. **Verify firing confirmation:**
   - ✅ Publish a test item to your RSS feed
   - ✅ Wait 15-30 minutes (IFTTT polling interval)
   - ✅ Check 3-5 Ring 1 accounts: test post should appear
   - ✅ Wait another 30 minutes
   - ✅ Check 3-5 Ring 2 accounts: post should appear (cascaded from Ring 1)

4. **Verify unique personas:**
   - ✅ Spot-check 5-10 accounts: different names, different bios, different profile photos
   - ✅ For Indian language networks: names are culturally appropriate

5. **Test account logins:**
   - ✅ Randomly select 5 accounts from spreadsheet
   - ✅ Log in using provided credentials
   - ✅ Verify posts are appearing on the account

**Phase 5: Acceptance or Revision Request**

If everything checks out:
- Mark Fiverr order as complete
- Leave 5-star review mentioning "IFTTT setup," "unique personas," "fingerprint-free"
- Tip $10-20 if quality exceeded expectations (builds relationship for future language orders)

If issues found:
- Request revision with specific details:
  - "5 Ring 1 accounts are using duplicate personas. Please create unique bios and profile photos."
  - "IFTTT applet for account [name] includes source attribution. Please remove and republish test post."
  - "3 accounts have incorrect login credentials in the spreadsheet. Please verify and update."
- Seller has revision window (typically 7-14 days) to fix

**Do NOT release payment until verification is complete.**

**5. Quality Assurance & Validation Checklist**

Provide comprehensive QA checklist for every syndication network purchased:

**DELIVERABLE VERIFICATION**

Master Login Spreadsheet:
- [ ] Contains 75+ rows (or agreed account count)
- [ ] All columns populated: Platform, URL, Username, Password, Email, Ring, Persona, IFTTT Applet ID, RSS Source
- [ ] No blank cells in critical columns
- [ ] Ring 1 count: 15-20 accounts
- [ ] Ring 2 count: 55-60 accounts (or 4× Ring 1 count)
- [ ] Platform mix includes Tumblr, WordPress, Blogger, Medium (or agreed platforms)
- [ ] File format is editable (Excel, Google Sheets, CSV — not PDF)

IFTTT Access:
- [ ] IFTTT login credentials provided
- [ ] Successfully logged into IFTTT account
- [ ] All applets visible in dashboard
- [ ] Applet count matches account count (75 applets for 75 accounts)
- [ ] All applets status: ON (green checkmark)
- [ ] No applets showing errors or warnings

**FINGERPRINT-FREE COMPLIANCE**

Unique Personas:
- [ ] Spot-check 10 accounts: all have different names
- [ ] Spot-check 10 accounts: all have different bios
- [ ] Spot-check 10 accounts: all have different profile photos
- [ ] For Indian languages: names are culturally appropriate (Hindi names for Hindi network, etc.)

- [ ] Bios are varied (not template copy-paste)

Zero Attribution:
- [ ] Manually check 5 Ring 1 posts: no "via [source]" text
- [ ] Manually check 5 Ring 2 posts: no backlinks to original RSS feed
- [ ] No "Powered by IFTTT" badges visible on posts
- [ ] Content appears native to the platform (not obviously syndicated)

**TECHNICAL VALIDATION**

IFTTT Applet Configuration:
- [ ] Ring 1 applets trigger source: Your Tier 1/2 RSS feed URL
- [ ] Ring 2 applets trigger source: Ring 1 account RSS feeds (not your main feed)
- [ ] Post templates do NOT include {{EntryUrl}} or similar backlink variables
- [ ] Post templates include: {{EntryTitle}}, {{EntryContent}} or {{EntryExcerpt}}, {{EntryImageURL}}
- [ ] Timing: applets set to check feed every 15-30 minutes (if IFTTT Pro) or 1 hour (free tier)

Firing Test:
- [ ] Published test item to RSS feed: [timestamp]
- [ ] Test item title: [record title for tracking]
- [ ] Waited 30 minutes
- [ ] Checked 5 Ring 1 accounts: test post appeared on 5/5 accounts
- [ ] Waited additional 60 minutes
- [ ] Checked 5 Ring 2 accounts: test post appeared on 5/5 accounts (cascaded from Ring 1)
- [ ] Post timing aligns with IFTTT polling interval

Account Access:
- [ ] Randomly selected 10 accounts from spreadsheet
- [ ] Successfully logged into 10/10 accounts using provided credentials
- [ ] Each account shows recent posts (test post or historical content)
- [ ] No accounts locked, suspended, or requiring verification
- [ ] Email addresses associated with accounts are accessible (or documented as disposable)

**SECURITY & ISOLATION**

Fingerprint Isolation:
- [ ] Satellite accounts use emails separate from HQ domain
- [ ] No satellite account bios mention your brand or organization
- [ ] IFTTT account is separate from your personal/HQ IFTTT account
- [ ] Master login spreadsheet stored in encrypted location (not cloud unless encrypted)
- [ ] No satellite account URLs are linked from your main website or social profiles

Dashboard Configuration:
- [ ] Tier 4 section in dashboard Settings updated with account count
- [ ] Language added to "active syndication networks" list
- [ ] Network multiplier set correctly (75 for 2-tier network)
- [ ] Last audit date recorded
- [ ] No individual satellite account data entered in dashboard (aggregate only)

**ACCEPTANCE DECISION**

Issues Found:
- [ ] None — ready to accept delivery
- [ ] Minor issues (list below) — request revision
- [ ] Major issues (list below) — request revision or refund

Minor Issues (examples):
- 2-3 accounts have duplicate personas → seller can fix quickly
- 1-2 IFTTT applets not firing → seller needs to reconnect
- Spreadsheet missing IFTTT applet IDs → seller can add

Major Issues (grounds for refund):
- 20+ accounts share same persona template
- IFTTT applets systematically include backlinks/attribution
- Account credentials don't work for 50%+ accounts
- Seller used your email domain or brand name in satellite accounts
- Firing test fails: <50% of Ring 1 accounts showed test post

**NOTES:**
[Record any observations, seller communication, or decisions made during QA process]

**6. Ongoing Maintenance with Fiverr Sellers**

Detail quarterly audit process and long-term seller relationships:

**Quarterly Audit Process ($50/2-3 hours)**

Every 3 months, verify your syndication networks are still operational:

**Audit Checklist:**

1. **Firing Test (15 minutes):**
   - Publish a test item to each language's RSS feed
   - Wait 60 minutes
   - Check 3-5 Ring 1 accounts per language: confirm test post appeared
   - Check 3-5 Ring 2 accounts per language: confirm cascaded post appeared

2. **IFTTT Applet Health (30 minutes):**
   - Log into each IFTTT account
   - Review applet list: look for status warnings or errors
   - Check "Activity" tab: should show recent triggers and actions
   - If applets show "Connection lost" warnings, reconnect platforms

3. **Account Status (30 minutes):**
   - Randomly select 10 accounts from master spreadsheet
   - Visit account URLs: are they still active?
   - Look for suspension notices or "account deleted" messages
   - Update spreadsheet status column: active, suspended, deleted

4. **Platform API Changes (15 minutes):**
   - Check IFTTT service status: https://status.ifttt.com
   - Look for platform deprecation notices (e.g., "Tumblr API update")
   - Review IFTTT blog/changelog for breaking changes

5. **Dashboard Update (15 minutes):**
   - Calculate active account count (total minus suspended/deleted)
   - Update dashboard Settings → Tier 4 section with new count
   - Update "Last IFTTT audit date" field
   - If 20%+ accounts are down, flag for network rebuild

**When to Re-Engage Fiverr Sellers:**

1. **Broken IFTTT Applets (Quarterly Audit):**
   - Symptom: Firing test fails, applets show connection errors
   - Action: Contact original seller → "IFTTT applets for [language] network stopped firing. Please reconnect and verify. $20 for 1-hour fix."
   - If seller unavailable: hire new seller for "IFTTT applet repair" gig ($30-50)

2. **Suspended Accounts (Platform Purge):**
   - Symptom: 20+ accounts suddenly suspended (common after platform policy changes)
   - Action: Order replacement network from original seller or new seller
   - Cost: Typically 50% of original network cost ($50-75) since IFTTT applets already exist

3. **Platform Shutdown:**
   - Symptom: Platform announces closure (e.g., Medium ends free accounts)
   - Action: Order network rebuild on replacement platforms
   - Example: WordPress.com/Blogger/Medium → migrate to WordPress.com/Ghost/Write.as
   - Cost: Full network cost ($100) since new accounts must be created

4. **Scaling to New Languages:**
   - Trigger: Tier 1/2 RSS feed goes live for new language
   - Action: Order new syndication network for that language
   - Reuse same seller if previous networks performed well (faster delivery, seller knows your requirements)
   - Cost: $100 per language
   - Bulk discount: Some sellers offer discounts for ordering 3+ networks at once

**Troubleshooting Dead Accounts:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Ring 1 account stopped posting | IFTTT applet disconnected | Log into IFTTT → reconnect applet → test |
| Ring 2 account stopped posting | Ring 1 RSS feed down | Check Ring 1 account: was it suspended? Replace source feed in Ring 2 IFTTT applet |
| All accounts in one network silent | RSS feed URL changed or broke | Verify feed URL in browser → if broken, fix feed → IFTTT will resume automatically |
| Account login credentials invalid | Platform reset password policy | Use platform's password reset flow → update spreadsheet |
| Account suspended for spam | Platform detected automation pattern | Don't rebuild same account. Replace with new account + new persona + different IFTTT applet timing |
| IFTTT says "RSS feed not found" | Feed URL moved or feed auth required | Verify feed publicly accessible → if auth required, switch to public feed URL |

**Maintenance Budget Planning:**

Year 1:
- 5 languages × $100 = $500 (initial setup)
- 4 quarterly audits × $50 = $200
- 1 applet repair incident = $30
- **Total: $730**

Year 2-5:
- 0 new networks (already have 5 languages)
- 4 quarterly audits × $50 = $200/year
- 1 platform purge/year requiring partial rebuild = $100/year
- **Total: ~$300/year per 5 languages**

Scaling to 25 languages:
- Year 1: 25 × $100 = $2,500 setup + $200 audits = **$2,700**
- Year 2+: $200 audits + $500 repairs/replacements = **$700/year**

**The networks are a one-time investment that runs indefinitely with minimal ongoing cost.**

**7. Integration with Existing Workflow**

Explain how Tier 4 connects to the overall distribution pipeline:

**IFTTT Autopilot Flow (Text + Images):**

```
Your Tier 1/2 RSS feed (RSSground or Ghost)
    ↓ IFTTT monitors feed (polls every 15-30 min)
Ring 1 IFTTT applets fire → auto-post to 15-20 satellite accounts
    ↓ Ring 1 accounts generate their own RSS feeds
Ring 2 IFTTT applets fire → auto-post to 60 satellite accounts
    ↓
Total: 75 posts distributed across unbranded accounts
(No dashboard tracking — by design)
```

**Ubot Native Upload Flow (Video + Audio):**

```
Pabbly Connect detects high-value content (flag: highValueForSyndication)
    ↓
Pabbly creates JSON file in Syndication Upload Queue/Pending/
    ↓ Google Drive sync to Ubot machine
Ubot Studio bot monitors queue (runs 2-5x/week)
    ↓
Ubot reads JSON → logs into satellite accounts from master spreadsheet
    ↓
Ubot uploads video/audio natively to Tumblr/WordPress (NOT via IFTTT)
    ↓
Ubot moves JSON to Completed/ folder
(No dashboard webhooks called — fingerprint isolation)
```

**Setting Up the Connection:**

1. **Tier 1/2 Feed → IFTTT:**
   - Ensure your RSSground Tier 1 feed or Ghost Tier 2 feed is publicly accessible
   - Provide feed URL to Fiverr seller when ordering network
   - IFTTT applets point to this URL
   - When you publish content to feed, IFTTT handles distribution automatically
   - No manual posting required

2. **Pabbly → Syndication Upload Queue:**
   - In Pabbly workflow, add conditional step:
     ```
     IF metadata.flags.highValueForSyndication == true
     THEN create JSON file in Syndication Upload Queue/Pending/
     ```
   - JSON format:
     ```json
     {
       "contentTitle": "The Vine and the Branches",
       "mediaUrl": "https://yourstorage.com/vine-branches.mp4",
       "mediaType": "video",
       "caption": "Teaching on John 15 about abiding in Christ...",
       "targetPlatforms": ["tumblr", "wordpress"],
       "targetAccounts": ["ring1_tumblr_priya", "ring1_wordpress_anjali"],
       "language": "hi"
     }
     ```
   - Ubot picks up and processes (separate bot from Followr bot)

3. **Master Login Spreadsheet Storage:**
   - Store in encrypted location:
     - Option 1: Encrypted USB drive (offline backup)
     - Option 2: Password-protected cloud (Bitwarden, 1Password, encrypted Google Drive)
     - Option 3: Encrypted local file (VeraCrypt container)
   - **Do NOT store in plain text on dashboard server**
   - **Do NOT commit to Git repository**
   - Access only when needed for Ubot bot updates or account troubleshooting

4. **Dashboard Configuration (Tier 4 Estimates):**
   - Navigate to /dashboard/settings → Platforms tab → Tier 4 section
   - Input configuration:
     - Estimated satellite accounts: 75 (per network) × 5 languages = 375 total
     - Network multiplier: 75 (posts per RSS item)
     - Languages with active networks: English, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, Tamil
     - Last IFTTT audit date: [date of most recent quarterly check]
   - Dashboard uses this for Metrics page estimates ONLY
   - No individual account tracking (fingerprint isolation)
   - Update these numbers after each network order or quarterly audit

**What NOT to Do:**

- ❌ Don't link satellite accounts from your branded social profiles
- ❌ Don't call dashboard webhooks from IFTTT or Ubot native uploads (breaks fingerprint isolation)
- ❌ Don't use your HQ email domain for satellite accounts
- ❌ Don't manually post from satellite accounts (keep them IFTTT-only)
- ❌ Don't store master spreadsheet on dashboard server or in Git
- ❌ Don't mention satellite accounts in public documentation or team communications

**Set-and-Forget Philosophy:**

Once networks are set up:
- IFTTT runs 24/7 automatically (no intervention needed)
- Ubot native upload runs on schedule (2-5x/week batch process)
- Quarterly audits catch 90% of issues before they impact reach
- Total time investment: 3-4 hours/quarter for all 5-25 languages
- Content multiplies across 75-2,000 accounts with zero ongoing posting work

**8. Scaling Strategy: 5 Languages → 25 Languages**

Provide phased roadmap for scaling syndication networks:

**Recommended Build Order:**

**Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Months 1-2)**
- Language: English
- Cost: $100
- Goal: Validate seller quality, test IFTTT firing, learn QA process
- Success metric: 90%+ firing rate for 30 days

**Phase 2: Tier 1 Priority Languages (Months 2-4)**
- Languages: Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, Tamil (4 networks)
- Cost: $400
- Prerequisite: Tier 1 RSS feeds live for these languages
- Goal: Cover 60% of India's language landscape
- Seller: Reuse same seller from Phase 1 if quality was high (faster turnaround, volume discount possible)

**Phase 3: Tier 1 Secondary Languages (Months 4-8)**
- Languages: Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Odia, Assamese, Maithili, Bhojpuri (10 networks)
- Cost: $1,000
- Prerequisite: Tier 1/2 feeds live or promotion to Tier 1 imminent
- Goal: Cover 90% of India + South Asian diaspora
- Tip: Order in batches of 3-5 to negotiate bulk pricing

**Phase 4: Tier 2 Expansion Languages (Months 8-12)**
- Languages: Nepali, Sindhi, Santali, Kashmiri, Konkani, Manipuri, Bodo, Dogri, Meitei, Sanskrit (10 networks)
- Cost: $1,000
- Prerequisite: Field multiplication activity detected in these languages
- Goal: Full UPG coverage across South Asia

**Phase 5: Global Reach (Year 2+)**
- Languages: 50-100 additional languages as field work expands
- Deployment trigger: M2L data shows organic sharing in new language → promote to Tier 1 → order syndication network within 7 days
- Ongoing cost: $100/language as needed

**Budget Management:**

Total 25-language investment: **$2,500**
- Allocate from content distribution budget (not infrastructure budget)
- Amortize over 5 years: **$500/year**
- Compare to paid ads: $2,500 buys ~2-3 days of Google Ads traffic
- Syndication networks run 5+ years with minimal maintenance

Cost-saving strategies:
- Bulk ordering: Ask seller for 10-network discount (typically 10-15% off)
- Reuse seller relationships: Repeat customers often get priority support
- Stagger timing: Order 2-3 networks/month to spread cash flow impact
- Audit efficiency: Combine all language audits into single quarterly session

**Prioritization Framework:**

When deciding which language to build next:

**High Priority (order within 30 days):**
- Language has Tier 1 RSS feed with 10+ items
- M2L data shows multiplication in this language
- Field team requests "content saturation" for this language group

**Medium Priority (order within 90 days):**
- Language has Tier 2 feed with 20+ items
- Tier 1 promotion pending
- Large diaspora population (e.g., Punjabi in Canada/UK)

**Low Priority (defer):**
- Language has <10 content items
- No field activity detected yet
- Tier 2 feed not yet created

**Tracking Expansion:**

Use dashboard Settings → Tier 4 section:
- Update "Languages with active networks" multi-select
- Update "Estimated satellite accounts" (add 75 per new network)
- Update "Last IFTTT audit date" after each quarterly check
- Export this data to measure ROI:
  - 5 languages = 375 accounts = ~28,000 posts/year (assuming daily publishing × 75 multiplier)
  - 25 languages = 1,875 accounts = ~140,000 posts/year
  - Cost per post delivered: $2,500 ÷ 140,000 = **$0.018/post**

**9. Ubot Native Upload Flow**

Ubot Native Upload Flow: Syndication Upload Queue/Pending/ JSON files → Ubot logs into satellite accounts → uploads video/audio natively → moves to Completed/

Show example JSON:
```json
{
  "contentTitle": "The Vine and the Branches",
  "mediaUrl": "https://yourstorage.com/vine-branches.mp4",
  "mediaType": "video",
  "caption": "Teaching on John 15 about abiding in Christ. Full message available in bio.",
  "targetPlatforms": ["tumblr", "wordpress"],
  "targetAccounts": ["ring1_tumblr_priya", "ring1_wordpress_anjali"],
  "language": "hi"
}
```

One bot per platform type (Tumblr bot, WordPress bot, Blogger bot). Does NOT call dashboard webhooks (fingerprint isolation).

**Security**

Encrypted master spreadsheet (NOT in Google Drive). Separate IFTTT credentials. Dashboard has zero Tier 4 individual account knowledge — only aggregate estimates.

**Maintenance**

~$50/year, quarterly IFTTT audit (verify applets firing, reconnect broken ones). Re-record Ubot bots if platform UIs change (rare, typically 1-2x/year per platform).

**10. Fiverr Seller Brief Template (Copy-Paste Ready)**

Provide a complete, ready-to-use template that operators can paste directly into Fiverr order forms:

**PROJECT TITLE:**
2-Tier IFTTT Syndication Network — [LANGUAGE] Content Distribution

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

I need a 2-tier IFTTT syndication network for automated content distribution from an RSS feed.

**SPECIFICATIONS:**

- Ring 1: 15-20 Web 2.0 accounts (Tumblr, WordPress.com, Blogger, Medium)
- Ring 2: 60 accounts across 4 persona groups (same platforms)
- All accounts connected via IFTTT applets
- RSS feed source: [YOUR RSS FEED URL — I will provide this when order starts]
- Language: [English / Hindi / Bengali / Tamil / Urdu / etc.]
- Content type: Biblical teachings, devotionals, Christian discipleship content

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Zero Fingerprints:**
   - No backlinks to source RSS feed in posts
   - No "via [source]" or attribution text
   - Each account has unique persona (name, bio, profile photo)
   - [For Indian languages: Use culturally appropriate regional names and bios]

2. **IFTTT Configuration:**
   - Ring 1 applets: trigger on my RSS feed → post to Ring 1 accounts
   - Ring 2 applets: trigger on Ring 1 account RSS feeds → post to Ring 2 accounts
   - Post template: {{EntryTitle}} + {{EntryContent}} + {{EntryImageURL}} (NO backlinks)
   - All applets must be active and firing at delivery

3. **Deliverables Required:**
   - Master login spreadsheet (Excel/Google Sheets) with: Platform, Account URL, Username, Password, Email, Ring, Persona Name, IFTTT Applet ID, RSS Source, Status
   - IFTTT account login credentials (create new IFTTT account for this project)
   - List of all IFTTT applets with status: ON
   - Public URLs for all satellite accounts
   - Firing confirmation: Publish test item to my feed, show it auto-posted to Ring 1 and cascaded to Ring 2

**QUALITY STANDARDS:**

- All personas must be unique (no duplicate names/bios/photos)
- Accounts must use different email addresses (disposable/burner emails OK)
- IFTTT applets must include NO source attribution or "Powered by" badges
- Accounts should look like independent blogs/accounts, not part of a network

**TIMELINE:**

- Preferred delivery: 5-7 days
- I will verify firing confirmation before marking order complete
- If IFTTT applets stop working within 30 days of delivery, please fix at no additional charge

**WHAT I WILL PROVIDE:**

- RSS feed URL (once order is in progress)
- Content niche description (above)
- Language and regional preferences (above)

**QUESTIONS FOR YOU:**

Before I place this order, please confirm:
1. You can create IFTTT applets for RSS-to-Web 2.0 automation
2. You will create unique personas for each account (especially regional names for [language])
3. You can ensure zero backlinks and zero source attribution in the IFTTT post templates
4. The master spreadsheet will include all credentials and IFTTT applet IDs
5. I will receive login access to the IFTTT account(s) you create

**BUDGET:**

$[100-150] for this network

[Optional: I plan to order networks for 5-25 languages total. If you can offer a bulk discount for 3+ networks, please let me know.]

---

**ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (optional):**

This network is part of a Matthew 13 content distribution strategy — scattering biblical content across the digital landscape for seekers to discover organically. The goal is amplification without traceability. Content is CC0 licensed, so unattributed distribution is legally clean.

I'll be ordering networks for multiple languages over the next 6-12 months. If this first network performs well, you'll be my go-to provider for future orders.

PART 6: "Pabbly Connect Workflow Setup Guide"
Step-by-step for each workflow:

Workflow 1 — Content Ingest: Trigger (new file in Source Content) → content-received (with platformsTargeted) → content-queued → push to RSSground/external feed → rss-published → create Followr Queue JSON → optionally create Robomotion Queue JSON → optionally create Syndication Upload Queue JSON → trigger Workflow 2. Notes: platformsTargeted enables auto-completion, no pipeline-complete call needed.

Workflow 2 — Messaging Distribution: Trigger (from Workflow 1) → post to WhatsApp/Telegram/WordPress/Blogger → platform-posted for each (postedBy: "pabbly"). Does NOT call pipeline-complete. Auto-complete handles it.

Workflow 3 — Translation Ingest: Trigger (new file in Translations) → translation-received (with platformsTargeted) → content-queued → route to tier-appropriate feed → rss-published → create Followr Queue JSON → trigger Workflow 2.

Workflow 4 — Derivative Ingest: Trigger (new file in Derivatives) → content-received (isDerivative: true, platformsTargeted) → content-queued → push to Tier 2 feed → rss-published → create Followr Queue JSON → trigger Workflow 2.

Workflow 5 — Daily Maintenance: Schedule (midnight) → POST /api/cron/aggregate-metrics.

## SESSION 10: Polish and Deployment

### What This Session Builds
- Cross-page polish and consistency
- Deployment configuration (Docker, README)
- Final verification

### Prompt for Claude Code

```
Final session. Polish everything and prepare for deployment.

Read entire codebase first and note any rough edges, inconsistencies, or missing pieces across all pages.

FINAL POLISH:
Go through every page and ensure:

1. Loading states — skeleton loaders on every page. No blank screens while data loads.
2. Empty states — friendly messages with icons when tables have no data.
3. Error handling — toast notifications on API failures, not crashes. Wrap all fetch calls in try/catch.
4. Mobile responsive — tables scroll horizontally, sidebar collapses to hamburger menu, cards stack vertically.
5. Navigation — active page highlighted in sidebar. All internal links work (alerts → content items, alerts → feeds, platforms → content, feeds → settings, etc.).
6. Page titles — browser tab titles (e.g., "Pipeline | Distribution Dashboard", "Content | Distribution Dashboard").
7. Favicon — RSS or distribution network icon.
8. Tier consistency — every place content or feeds appear, the tier badge is visible. Gold for T1, blue for T2, gray for T3, muted purple for T4 (syndication). Check: pipeline overview, content table, content detail, platform health, feeds page, metrics charts, alerts, settings. All must use the same badge component and colors.
8b. Tool attribution consistency — every platform post shows which tool posted it: "Followr (Ubot)", "Pabbly", "Robomotion", or "RSSground". Tier 4 syndication posts are NOT shown individually. Use consistent badge colors across all pages. Check: content detail slide-out, platform detail slide-out, distribution timeline.
9. Sidebar Tier 1 capacity widget — visible on every page, always up to date. Verify it fetches fresh data.
10. Toast confirmations — when dismissing alerts, promoting feeds, toggling platforms, saving settings.

AUTHENTICATION CONSISTENCY CHECK:
Verify that ALL dashboard write endpoints require x-api-key:
- PUT /api/dashboard/platforms/:platformName
- POST /api/dashboard/feeds/create
- POST /api/dashboard/feeds/:id/promote
- PUT /api/dashboard/settings/tier-capacity
- PUT /api/dashboard/settings/syndication
- POST /api/alerts/dismiss
- POST /api/alerts/dismiss-all
All dashboard GET endpoints should be unauthenticated.
All /api/webhooks/* endpoints should require x-api-key (or RSSGROUND_WEBHOOK_KEY for /rssground/*).

DEPLOYMENT:

1. .env.example with all variables:
   - DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db
   - WEBHOOK_API_KEY=change-me-to-a-secure-key
   - RSSGROUND_WEBHOOK_KEY=change-me-rssground-key
   - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=optional
   - TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=optional
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

2. Dockerfile:
   - Base: node:20-alpine
   - Install dependencies
   - Generate Prisma client
   - Build Next.js
   - Run Prisma migrate on startup
   - Expose port 3000
   - Mount volume for SQLite database file

3. docker-compose.yml:
   - Service for the dashboard
   - .env file reference
   - Volume mount for database persistence
   - Port mapping 3000:3000

4. README.md:
   - Project description: "Distribution System Dashboard — a four-tier content distribution tracking system that integrates with RSSground (Tier 1 RSS feeds), external feed providers (Tier 2), social platforms via Followr/Ubot Studio, Pabbly Connect, and Robomotion (Tier 3), and IFTTT syndication networks for fingerprint-free amplification (Tier 4). Built for a ministry automation pipeline targeting 1 billion people globally."
   - Architecture overview: Four-tier strategy with brief explanation of each tier
   - Quick start: npm install → copy .env.example to .env → npx prisma migrate dev → npx prisma db seed → npm run dev
   - Docker deployment: docker-compose up
   - Integration setup references: point to /dashboard/docs for RSSground, Pabbly, Followr/Ubot, Robomotion, and IFTTT setup
   - Environment variable reference table
   - Tool stack: RSSground (Tier 1 RSS), Pabbly Connect (orchestration), Followr + Ubot Studio (social media posting + Tier 4 native uploads), Robomotion (edge-case platforms), IFTTT (Tier 4 syndication autopilot), Ghost/Cloudflare (Tier 2), Next.js + Prisma + SQLite (dashboard)

FINAL VERIFICATION:
Run the full app with "npm run dev". Visit every page:
- /dashboard — pipeline with tier stats, five stat cards, tier distribution row, pipeline visualization, recent activity
- /dashboard/content — filterable content with tier badges, content detail slide-out
- /dashboard/platforms — grouped by Followr/Ubot, Pabbly, Robomotion, RSSground, and Tier 4 Syndication summary
- /dashboard/feeds — tier sections with capacity bars, tier promotion
- /dashboard/metrics — tier distribution chart with Tier 4 toggle
- /dashboard/alerts — tier context on alerts, dismiss actions
- /dashboard/settings — tier capacity management, syndication config
- /dashboard/docs — webhook reference, setup guides, testing checklist

Verify:
- Tier 1 capacity widget in sidebar shows correctly on every page
- All tier badges are consistent colors (gold T1, blue T2, gray T3, muted purple T4)
- All links between pages work (clicking alert → goes to related content/feed/platform)
- Auto-refresh works on pipeline page (30 second interval)
- Seed data makes every page look realistic and populated
- No console errors in browser dev tools
- All API routes return proper JSON responses

Report any issues and fix them before finishing.

## Post-Build: Connecting Everything

### RSSground Setup (Tier 1 — RSS feeds only)
1. Log into RSSground
2. Create Personal Feeds for your Tier 1 languages and content types (start with English × 4 types = 4 feeds)
3. For each feed, create an Integration Posting Campaign
4. In the posting campaign, select "Webhook" as a destination and paste: `{your-dashboard-url}/api/webhooks/rssground/posting-fired`
5. **Do NOT add social platform destinations to RSSground** — social posting is handled by Followr via Ubot Studio
6. Register each feed in your dashboard via the Feeds page "Add Feed" button or directly via the API

### Followr + Ubot Studio Setup (Tier 3 — social media posting)
1. Log into Followr and set up your social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, YouTube, Medium)
2. Set up Autopilot tags in Followr matching your content types: "sermon", "teaching", "article", "derivative", etc.
3. Create the Followr Queue folder structure in Google Drive:
   - `Distribution Intake/Followr Queue/Pending/`
   - `Distribution Intake/Followr Queue/Completed/`
   - `Distribution Intake/Followr Queue/Failed/`
4. Build the Ubot Studio bot:
   - Record the manual flow of creating a post in Followr (login → create post → paste caption → upload media → select platforms → apply tags → schedule → submit)
   - Add file monitoring for the Followr Queue/Pending folder
   - Add HTTP request steps to call dashboard webhooks after each post
   - Add error handling that moves failed items to the Failed folder and calls the platform-failed webhook
   - Set the bot to run on a schedule (every 30 minutes recommended) or as a continuous folder watcher
5. Compile the bot as a standalone .exe and deploy to a Windows machine or VPS that runs 24/7
6. Test with one English sermon before scaling

### Robomotion Setup (Tier 3 — edge-case platforms)
1. Set up Robomotion on a machine with browser access
2. Build flows for Rumble, Odysee, and Signal
3. Create the Robomotion Queue folder structure in Google Drive
4. Configure flows to monitor the queue, post content, and call dashboard webhooks
5. Lower priority — set this up after the core pipeline (RSSground + Followr/Ubot) is working

### IFTTT Syndication Network Setup (Tier 4 — fingerprint-free amplification)
This is set up AFTER Tiers 1-3 are operational, because Tier 4 feeds from Tier 1/2 RSS feeds.

**Phase 1: Order the networks**
1. Find a syndication network seller on Fiverr, Upwork, or Legiit
2. Order a 2-tier network (1 branded ring + 4 persona rings, ~75 accounts) for English
3. Provide the seller with:
   - Your English RSS feed URLs (from RSSground Tier 1 feeds)
   - CRITICAL instruction: "No backlinks. No source attribution. Unique personas per account. Regional names/bios for Indian languages. Goal is content distribution with zero traceability."
   - Content niche description: "Biblical teachings, devotionals, prayer content"
4. Seller builds accounts, creates IFTTT applets, delivers master login spreadsheet
5. Verify applets are firing: check 2-3 satellite accounts for recent posts matching your RSS content
6. Repeat for Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, Tamil as those Tier 1 feeds go live

**Phase 2: Set up Ubot native uploads**
1. Create the Syndication Upload Queue folder structure (in a SEPARATE Google Drive account if possible)
2. Import the master login spreadsheet into Ubot Studio as a credential data source
3. Build one Ubot bot per platform type:
   - Tumblr native video/audio upload bot
   - WordPress native video/audio upload bot
   - Blogger native video/audio upload bot
4. Each bot: monitors queue → reads JSON → logs into satellite account → uploads media natively → moves JSON to Completed
5. Does NOT call dashboard webhooks (fingerprint isolation)
6. Schedule: run 2-5 times per week on a Windows machine/VPS
7. Test with one account per platform before scaling to full account list

**Phase 3: Scale**
1. As new languages get Tier 1/2 feeds, order syndication networks for those languages (~$100 each)
2. Target: 25 languages × ~75 accounts = ~2,000 satellite accounts, ~$2,500 total one-time
3. Update dashboard Settings → Tier 4 Syndication section with current account estimates
4. Budget ~$50/year for freelancer to audit and fix broken IFTTT applets quarterly

### Pabbly Connect Setup (Orchestration)
1. Create the workflows described in /dashboard/docs
2. Use RSSground as a Trigger (New Item in Personal Feed) or Action (Add Item to Personal Feed)
3. Add HTTP Request steps to call your dashboard webhooks at each pipeline stage
4. **Critical: Include `platformsTargeted` in the `content-received` call** — this is the total number of platforms (social + messaging + edge-case) this content will be posted to. Auto-completion depends on this number.
5. **Call `content-queued` after `content-received`** — this keeps the pipeline visualization accurate
6. For content that needs social posting: add a step that creates a JSON file in the Followr Queue folder (Ubot picks it up)
7. For messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram): Pabbly posts directly and calls `platform-posted` webhooks
8. For Rumble/Odysee/Signal content: add a step that creates a JSON file in the Robomotion Queue folder
9. For high-value video/audio content: add an optional step that creates a JSON file in the Syndication Upload Queue folder (Ubot picks it up for Tier 4 native uploads to satellite accounts)
10. **Do NOT call `pipeline-complete`** in normal operation — items auto-complete when `platformsCompleted >= platformsTargeted` via `platform-posted` calls from Ubot, Pabbly, and Robomotion

### Google Drive Setup
1. Create the folder structure from the docs page (including Followr Queue, Robomotion Queue, and Syndication Upload Queue)
2. Set Pabbly triggers on the Source Content, Derivatives, and Translations folders
3. Sync the Followr Queue folder to the Ubot machine (Google Drive for Desktop or similar)
4. Sync the Robomotion Queue folder to the Robomotion machine if different
5. Syndication Upload Queue: ideally in a SEPARATE Google Drive account for fingerprint isolation. Sync to the Ubot machine (Ubot handles both Followr Queue and Syndication Upload Queue).

### Testing
Follow the checklist on /dashboard/docs → "Testing Your Pipeline"
Start with one English sermon flowing through the full pipeline before adding languages.
Test each tool chain separately:
1. First: Pabbly → RSSground → Dashboard (Tier 1 flow). Verify content-received includes platformsTargeted and content-queued is called.
2. Second: Pabbly → Followr Queue → Ubot → Followr → Dashboard (Tier 3 social flow). Verify Ubot calls platform-posted for each platform.
3. Third: Pabbly → Direct messaging posts → Dashboard (Tier 3 messaging flow). Verify Pabbly calls platform-posted (not pipeline-complete).
4. Verify auto-complete: after both Ubot and Pabbly finish posting, confirm the item auto-completes when platformsCompleted reaches platformsTargeted.
5. Fifth: Robomotion Queue → Robomotion → Dashboard (Tier 3 edge-case flow)
6. Last: Verify Tier 4 IFTTT autopilot — publish a test item to an RSS feed, wait for IFTTT polling interval (5 min for Pro), check 2-3 satellite accounts for the post. Then test Ubot native upload — drop a test JSON in Syndication Upload Queue, verify Ubot logs into a satellite account and uploads media.

### Scaling
- When a new language shows multiplication activity in the field, go to /dashboard/feeds → Tier 2 section → find the language → click "Promote to Tier 1"
- Monitor Tier 1 capacity in the sidebar widget
- Keep 50 Tier 1 slots reserved for languages identified through M2L and field reports
- Add Tier 2 feeds freely as needed — they're unlimited and cheap
- If Followr's UI changes break the Ubot bot, fix it within 1-2 hours by re-recording the affected steps
- If Followr adds RSS feed import in the future, switch to that and retire the Ubot bot
- **Tier 4 scaling workflow:** When field data or M2L signals indicate a language is gaining traction, follow this 7-step process:

  1. **Detection:** Dashboard flags language with 10+ Tier 2 items or multiplication activity detected
  2. **Promotion:** Promote language to Tier 1 (if not already promoted)
  3. **Feed Verification:** Verify Tier 1 RSS feed is live and publicly accessible
  4. **Order Network:** Place Fiverr order using Seller Brief Template (see /dashboard/docs PART 5, section 10)
  5. **QA Process:** Follow Quality Assurance Checklist upon delivery (see /dashboard/docs PART 5, section 5)
  6. **Dashboard Update:** Add language to Settings → Tier 4 section, increment account count by 75
  7. **Monitor:** Include in next quarterly IFTTT audit

  **Timeline:** 7-10 days from detection to live syndication network

- **Tier 4 ROI calculation** to justify expansion:

  Cost per language: $100 one-time + $50/year maintenance

  Posts generated per year: 75 accounts × [publishing frequency]
  - Daily publishing: 75 × 365 = **27,375 posts/year**
  - 3×/week publishing: 75 × 156 = **11,700 posts/year**
  - Weekly publishing: 75 × 52 = **3,900 posts/year**

  Cost per post delivered:
  - Daily: $100 ÷ 27,375 = **$0.0037/post** (first year), **$0.0018/post** (years 2-5)
  - 3×/week: $100 ÷ 11,700 = **$0.0085/post** (first year), **$0.0043/post** (years 2-5)

  Compare to social media ads:
  - Facebook CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions): $5-15
  - Syndication network "CPM" equivalent: ~$0.10-0.50 depending on account reach
  - **Syndication networks are 10-50× cheaper than paid ads and run indefinitely**

  25-language investment example:
  - Total cost: $2,500 one-time + $700/year maintenance
  - With daily publishing: 1,875 accounts × 365 = **684,375 posts/year**
  - Cost per post: $2,500 ÷ 684,375 = **$0.0037** first year, **$0.001** years 2-5
  - Compare to Google Ads: $2,500 buys ~2-3 days of ad traffic; syndication networks run for 5+ years

- **Tier 4 native uploads:** As satellite account count grows, prioritize Ubot native uploads to the highest-performing accounts per language (check manually which Tumblr/WordPress blogs show engagement). Don't try to upload to all 2,000 accounts — pick the top 10-20 per language for native video/audio. This focuses effort on accounts that are actually driving results.

- **Tier 4 maintenance:** Budget one quarterly audit (~2 hours or ~$50 freelancer) to verify IFTTT applets are still firing and fix any that broke due to platform API changes. Quarterly audits catch 90% of issues before they impact reach. See /dashboard/docs PART 5, section 6 for detailed audit process.
